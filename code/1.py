Let's evaluate the situation step by step.\textbackslash n\textbackslash n1. **Initial Situation**: \textbackslash n   - James currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs. \textbackslash n   - There are 8 additional dogs in the shelter now.\textbackslash n   - Total number of dogs = 4 (existing) + 8 (new) = 12 dogs.\textbackslash n\textbackslash n2. **First Toy Purchase**: \textbackslash n   - James needs to buy toys for all 12 dogs, so he needs 12 toys.\textbackslash n\textbackslash n3. **After the Purchase**: \textbackslash n   - After buying the toys, he goes back and finds that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. \textbackslash n   - When he left, there were 12 dogs. Twice as many more dogs means he has 12 dogs + (2 * 12) = 12 + 24 = 36 dogs.\textbackslash n\textbackslash n4. **Second Toy Requirement**: \textbackslash n   - So now, James needs toys for 36 dogs.\textbackslash n\textbackslash n5. **Dogs Adopted/Removed**: \textbackslash n   - When he came back again, 3 dogs were adopted (or gone).\textbackslash n   - Thus, the new total number of dogs = 36 - 3 = 33 dogs.\textbackslash n\textbackslash n6. **Final Requirement**: \textbackslash n   - Therefore, James needs toys for 33 dogs.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nIn conclusion, James needs a total of 33 toys for the dogs in the shelter. \textbackslash nTherefore, the answer is (33).", 'true_answer': 'James has 4+8=<<4+8=12>>12 toys .There were 12*2=<<12*2=24>>24 dogs .James needed to buy 24-12=<<24-12=12>>12 more toys .There are 36 total toys .36-3=<<36-3=33>>33 toys are now needed .So the final answer is 33
