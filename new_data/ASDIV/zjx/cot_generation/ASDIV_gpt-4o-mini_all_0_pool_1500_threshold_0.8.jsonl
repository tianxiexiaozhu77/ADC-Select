{"question": "As the first day of autumn arrived, Sarah woke up excited to pick apples and do housework. Sarah found several old jars to use as planters for her apple seeds. If she has 48 apple seeds and there are 6 jars, how many seeds will go into each jar if she shares them equally?", "cot": "To find out how many apple seeds will go into each jar when they are shared equally, we need to divide the total number of apple seeds by the number of jars. The total number of apple seeds is 48, and the number of jars is 6. Using the division operation: 48 \u00f7 6 = 8. This means that each jar will contain 8 seeds. Thus, the final answer confirms that Sarah can place 8 seeds in each jar.", "answer": "8", "score": 5.580750172496551}
{"question": "There are 35 students and 1400 pears. Each student has 10 jelly beans. If the pears are divided equally among the students, how many does each student get?", "cot": "To find out how many pears each student gets, we need to divide the total number of pears by the total number of students. We have 1400 pears and 35 students. We perform the division: 1400 \u00f7 35. Simplifying this, we can first divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5, which results in 280 \u00f7 7. Then, performing the division gives us 40. Therefore, each student receives 40 pears.", "answer": "40", "score": 5.498132154624533}
{"question": "There are 56 students and 2240 oranges. Each student has 12 gummy bears. If the oranges are divided equally among the students, how many does each student get?", "cot": "To find out how many oranges each student gets, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of students. We have 2240 oranges and 56 students. By performing the division, 2240 divided by 56 results in 40. Therefore, each student gets 40 oranges.", "answer": "Therefore, the answer is (40).", "score": 5.0118421881310145}
{"question": "James is in the grocery store sorting fruits. There are forty-five apples to sort in total but a customer takes fifteen of them, leaving James with the rest. If he can fit eight apples in a basket, how many baskets will he need?", "cot": "1. Start with the total number of apples: 45 apples. 2. A customer takes 15 apples. We need to find out how many apples James has left. 3. Subtract the number of apples taken by the customer from the total number of apples: 45 - 15 = 30 apples left. 4. Now, we need to determine how many baskets are required to hold these 30 apples. 5. Each basket can fit 8 apples. 6. Divide the number of apples left by the capacity of each basket: 30 / 8 = 3.75. 7. Since James cannot use a fraction of a basket, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 8. Therefore, James will need 4 baskets to hold all 30 apples.", "answer": "4", "score": 5.893444892008686}
{"question": "Both of them were required to calculate the total number of apples in the orchard. Sarah counted a total of 15 apple trees and John said that there are 40 apples on each tree. How many apples do they have in total?", "cot": "To find the total number of apples in the orchard, we need to multiply the number of apple trees by the number of apples on each tree. Sarah counted a total of 15 apple trees and John indicated that there are 40 apples on each tree. We can perform the calculation as follows: Total apples = Number of trees * Apples per tree = 15 * 40. This results in a total of 600 apples in the orchard.", "answer": "600", "score": 5.289905545891166}
{"question": "In a grocery store, the staff stacked 108 apples, 144 bananas, and 216 oranges. They are making fruit baskets for a community event. Each basket will contain the same number of apples, bananas, and oranges. How many baskets can they create if they desire the maximum number of fruits in each basket?", "cot": "To find out how many baskets can be created with the maximum number of fruits in each basket, we need to determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the quantities of apples, bananas, and oranges. We have 108 apples, 144 bananas, and 216 oranges. To find the GCD, we can use the prime factorization method:\n\n1. Calculate the prime factorization of each quantity:\n   - 108 = 2^2 * 3^3\n   - 144 = 2^4 * 3^2\n   - 216 = 2^3 * 3^3\n\n2. Identify the common prime factors with the smallest powers:\n   - For 2: the smallest power is 2^2 (from 108).\n   - For 3: the smallest power is 3^2 (from 144).\n\n3. Multiply these together to find the GCD:\n   - GCD = 2^2 * 3^2 = 4 * 9 = 36.\n\n4. Now, divide each fruit quantity by the GCD to determine how many baskets can be made:\n   - Apples: 108 / 36 = 3\n   - Bananas: 144 / 36 = 4\n   - Oranges: 216 / 36 = 6\n\n5. The total number of baskets that can be created is the same as the GCD, since each basket will contain the highest uniform number of each fruit. Therefore, the maximum number of baskets using the GCD is 36. Hence, the maximum number of baskets they can create is 36.  \n\nThus, the final answer is 36.", "answer": "36", "score": 6.2675781903806325}
{"question": "There are 60 students and 2400 blueberries. Each student has 20 sour candies. If the blueberries are divided equally among the students, how many does each student get?", "cot": "To find out how many blueberries each student gets, we need to divide the total number of blueberries by the number of students. We have 2400 blueberries and 60 students. Thus, we perform the calculation: 2400 divided by 60. Performing the division, we get 2400 / 60 = 40. Therefore, each student will receive 40 blueberries.", "answer": "Therefore, the answer is (40).", "score": 5.159771663013135}
{"question": "Emma is preparing snack packs for her team by making identical bags of fruits and nuts. She has 60 apples and 30 bags of mixed nuts that need to be used. If Emma puts together the highest number of identical bags possible, how many apples will be in each bag?", "cot": "To find the highest number of identical bags of fruits and nuts that Emma can prepare, we need to determine the common factor between the number of apples (60) and the number of bags of nuts (30). We start by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 60 and 30. The GCD can be found by listing the factors of each number: \nFactors of 60: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60 \nFactors of 30: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30 \nThe largest factor in both lists is 30, meaning the highest number of identical bags Emma can create is 30. Next, we divide the total number of apples by the number of bags: 60 apples \u00f7 30 bags = 2 apples per bag. \nTherefore, each bag will contain 2 apples.", "answer": "2", "score": 5.905059239136024}
