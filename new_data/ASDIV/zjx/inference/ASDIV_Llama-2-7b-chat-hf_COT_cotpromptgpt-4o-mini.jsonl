We know that 15 tons is the maximum load for a large truck, so we can use at most 15 large trucks to load 134 tons of fruits.\n2. However, we also know that 7 tons is the maximum load for a small truck, so we can use at most 19 small trucks to load the remaining amount of fruits (134 tons - 15 tons).\n3. To find the number of large trucks we need, we can divide the total amount of fruits by the maximum load of a large truck: 134 tons / 15 tons = 9 large trucks.\n4. To find the number of small trucks we need, we can divide the remaining amount of fruits by the maximum load of a small truck: 134 tons - 15 tons = 119 tons / 7 tons = 17 small trucks.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (5.0) large trucks and (17.0) small trucks. 🚚🐑", 'true_answer': '8 (large trucks)'}

So, the first bus leaves stop A at 2:45 + 15 minutes = 3:00.\n\nFrom stop A to stop D, the buses set out every 10 minutes. So, the first bus leaves stop A at 2:45 + 10 minutes = 2:55.\n\nNow, let's find out when the next three buses will set out together:\n\nFrom stop B, the next bus leaves at 3:25 (20 minutes after the first bus).\nFrom stop C, the next bus leaves at 3:10 (15 minutes after the first bus).\nFrom stop D, the next bus leaves at 3:00 (10 minutes after the first bus).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (5.0) = 3:25, 3:10, and 3:00, which are the times when the next three buses will set out together.", 'true_answer': '3:45'}

As a helpful llama assistant, I'm here to guide you through the solution. 😊\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Boss A appears every 1 hour, so it will appear again at 11:00.\n2. Boss B appears every 30 minutes, so it will appear again at 10:40.\n3. Boss C appears every 40 minutes, so it will appear again at 10:20.\n\nNow, we need to find the time when all three bosses will appear together again in the game. Let's use a little logic:\n\nSince Boss A appears every 1 hour, it will appear again after 1 hour from the time it last appeared. So, if it last appeared at 10:10, it will appear again at 11:10.\n\nSimilarly, since Boss B appears every 30 minutes, it will appear again after 30 minutes from the time it last appeared. So, if it last appeared at 10:10, it will appear again at 10:40.\n\nAnd since Boss C appears every 40 minutes, it will appear again after 40 minutes from the time it last appeared. So, if it last appeared at 10:10, it will appear again at 10:50.\n\nNow, let's see when all three bosses will appear together again:\n\nBoss A appears at 11:10, Boss B appears at 10:40, and Boss C appears at 10:50. Therefore, the three bosses will appear together again at 11:50.\n\nSo, the answer to the problem is (5.0), which means the three bosses will appear together again in the game at 11:50. 😊\n\nI hope that helps!

As a helpful llama, I'm here to guide you through the process.\n\nLet's start by using the information given in the problem:\n\n* A box of apples was delivered to Paul's Pies and Cakes.\n* He put half of the apples aside for a pie he would make later.\n* He put 25 of the remaining apples in the refrigerator.\n* That left 6 apples to use in his muffins.\n\nNow, let's think step by step to find out how many apples were in the box at first:\n\n1. Half of the apples were set aside for a pie, so the number of apples left for muffins is half of the total number of apples.\n2. Paul put 25 apples in the refrigerator, so the number of apples left for muffins is the original number of apples minus the number of apples put in the refrigerator.\n3. Therefore, the number of apples in the box at first is the original number of apples minus the number of apples set aside for a pie and the number of apples put in the refrigerator.\n\nNow, let's write the equation using Arabic numerals:\n\n(Original number of apples) - (Number of apples set aside for a pie) - (Number of apples put in the refrigerator) = (Number of apples in the box at first)\n\nUsing the values given in the problem, we can plug them into the equation:\n\n(Number of apples in the box at first) = (50) - (25) - (6)\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation:\n\n(Number of apples in the box at first) = 29\n\nTherefore, the answer is (5.0).", 'true_answer': '62 (apples)'}

Let's assume that each table can seat 8 people (this is a reasonable number for a dinner table).\n3. Now, let's calculate the number of tables the planner can set up: 32 people / 8 people per table = 4 tables.\n4. Since we can't have a fraction of a table, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the greatest number of tables the planner can set up is 5 tables.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (5.0).", 'true_answer': '4 (tables)'}

Let's break it down step by step to find out how many callers must call before someone wins both a $100 bill and a Jingle Ball ticket.\n\nFirst, let's look at the probability of winning a $100 bill:\n\nThere are 100 callers in total, and the 100th caller will win the $100 bill. So, the probability of winning the $100 bill is 1/100.\n\nNow, let's look at the probability of winning a Jingle Ball ticket:\n\nThere are 40 callers in total before the next $100 bill is given away, and the 40th caller will win the Jingle Ball ticket. So, the probability of winning a Jingle Ball ticket is 40/100.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of winning both the $100 bill and the Jingle Ball ticket. Since these are independent events, we can multiply the probabilities together:\n\nProbability of winning both = (1/100) x (40/100) = 4/100\n\nNow, we need to find the number of callers before someone wins both the $100 bill and the Jingle Ball ticket.
