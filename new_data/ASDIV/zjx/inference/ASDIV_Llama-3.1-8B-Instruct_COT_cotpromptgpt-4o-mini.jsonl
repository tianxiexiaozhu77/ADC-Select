Now, we can find the difference in weight between a cake and a piece of bread:\n   Difference in weight = Weight of one cake - Weight of one piece of bread\n   Difference in weight = 200 g - 100 g\n   Difference in weight = 100 g\n\nTherefore, the answer is 100.', 'true_answer': '100 (g)'}

However, we don't know how many of the 28 addition and subtraction problems Steve answered. \n\nSince Steve can only answer 38 questions, we can assume that he answered all the word problems (17) and some of the addition and subtraction problems. \n\nLet's say Steve answered x addition and subtraction problems. Then, the total number of questions he answered is 17 (word problems) + x (addition and subtraction problems).\n\nWe know that the total number of questions Steve answered is 38. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n17 + x = 38\n\nTo solve for x, we subtract 17 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 38 - 17\nx = 21\n\nSo, Steve answered 21 addition and subtraction problems.\n\nNow, we know that Steve answered 17 word problems and 21 addition and subtraction problems, for a total of 38 questions. To find out how many questions he left blank, we subtract the number of questions he answered from the total number of questions:\n\n45 (total questions) - 38 (questions answered) = 7\n\nTherefore, the answer is 7.", 'true_answer': '7 (questions)'}

Jemma filled one-fourth of the barrel with compost on Saturday. This means she filled 1/4 of the barrel.\n\n2. On Sunday, she filled the remaining space with 4200 grams of compost. Since she filled 1/4 of the barrel on Saturday, 3/4 of the barrel was left empty.\n\n3. The 4200 grams of compost she added on Sunday filled the remaining 3/4 of the barrel.\n\n4. To find the total capacity of the barrel, we can set up a proportion: 3/4 of the barrel = 4200 grams. We can solve for the total capacity (let's call it x) by multiplying both sides by 4/3.\n\n   (3/4) * x = 4200\n   x = 4200 * (4/3)\n   x = 5600 grams\n\n5. Now that we know the total capacity of the barrel is 5600 grams, we can find the total amount of compost in the barrel by adding the compost Jemma filled on Saturday and Sunday.\n\n   Total compost = Compost on Saturday + Compost on Sunday\n   Total compost = (1/4) * 5600 + 4200\n   Total compost = 1400 + 4200\n   Total compost = 5600 grams\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5600.", 'true_answer': '5.6 (kilograms of compost)'}

So, the total number of tickets Beatriz won is also 5x.\n\nSince they have the same total number of tickets, we can set up the equation:\n\n5x = 11y\n\nHowever, this equation is not correct because we don't know how many games Beatriz played. We know that Enzo played 'x' games, but we don't know how many games Beatriz played.\n\nLet's think about it in a different way. If Enzo and Beatriz have the same number of tickets, and Enzo wins 5 tickets per game, then the number of games Beatriz played must be a multiple of 5, because 11 is 6 more than 5, and we need to make the total number of tickets equal.\n\nLet's say Beatriz played 'y' games. Then, the total number of tickets Beatriz won is 11y.\n\nSince they have the same total number of tickets, we can set up the equation:\n\n5x = 11y\n\nWe want to find the minimum number of games Enzo played, so we want to find the smallest value of 'x' that satisfies the equation.\n\nTo do this, we can try to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 11. The LCM of 5 and 11 is 55.\n\nSince 5x = 11y, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5 to get:\n\nx = (11/5)y\n\nTo find the smallest value of 'x', we can set y = 5, which is the smallest multiple of 5.\n\nx = (11/5)(5)\nx = 11\n\nHowever, this is not the minimum number of games Enzo played, because we assumed that Beatriz played 5 games. We need to find the smallest multiple of 5 that is greater than 11.\n\nLet's try y = 10:\n\nx = (11/5)(10)\nx = 22\n\nThis is still not the minimum number of games Enzo played, because we assumed that Beatriz played 10 games. We need to find the smallest multiple of 5 that is greater than 22.\n\nLet's try y = 15:\n\nx = (11/5)(15)\nx = 33\n\nThis is the minimum number of games Enzo played.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 33.", 'true_answer': '11 (games)'}

We know that each time Miranda spends $7 and each time Savannah spends $9.\n\nThe total amount spent by Miranda is 7M and the total amount spent by Savannah is 9S.

Since the order of the flowers in the garland doesn't matter, we can use the formula for combinations.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of flowers: \n8 (roses) + 12 (daisies) + 48 (marigolds) = 68 flowers\n\nWe want to find the number of ways to choose 68 flowers out of 68, which is a combination of all the flowers. The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items being chosen.\n\nIn this case, n = 68 (total flowers) and r = 68 (all the flowers are being chosen). \n\nSo, 68C68 = 68! / (68! * (68-68)!) = 68! / (68! * 0!) = 1\n\nHowever, this is a special case where we are choosing all the items, and the formula simplifies to 1. But, if we were to use the combination formula for a different number of flowers, we would need to calculate the factorial of 68, which is a very large number.\n\nA more practical approach is to use the concept of permutations, since the order of the flowers in the garland matters. However, since the garland is a linear arrangement, we can think of it as a string of 68 flowers. The number of ways to arrange 68 flowers in a row is 68!.\n\nBut, since we are making a garland, we can also think of it as a circular arrangement. In this case, we need to divide the total number of permutations by the number of rotations, which is 68. However, this is a circular permutation, and we need to divide by 68 to account for the rotations.\n\nSo, the number of circular permutations is 67! (since we are dividing by 68).\n\nHowever, this is still a very large number. To simplify the calculation, we can use the fact that the garland has a fixed length, and we are choosing a specific number of flowers to be in the garland. In this case, we are choosing all 68 flowers.\n\nA more practical approach is to use the concept of permutations with repetition, since we are choosing all the flowers. The number of permutations with repetition is 68! / (8! * 12! * 48!).\n\nThis is a more manageable calculation, and it gives us the total number of arrangements.\n\n68! / (8! * 12! * 48!) = 68! / (8! * 12! * 48!) = 1,850,016,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000", 'true_answer': '4 (arrangements)'}
