However, since we can't have half a star, we round down to 8 stars per can.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total area covered by the 8 stars on one can:\n\n1 can * X square inches per can * 8 stars per can = 8X square inches\n\nSince the total covered area is 4X square inches, we can set up the following equation:\n\n8X (from one can) = 4X (total area)\n\nSolving for X, we get X = 4X / 8 = 0.5X\n\nThis means that one can of gold paint covers an area of 0.5X square inches. Since there are 34 stars in total, the area covered by these stars is 34 * 0.5X = 17X square inches.\n\nSince the total area is 4X square inches, we can find the remaining unpainted area by subtracting the painted area from the total area:\n\n4X - 17X = -13X\n\nSince we don't have a value for X, we can't find the exact number of unpainted stars.

We know that at the end, there are 78 children in the bakery.\n2. We also know that 24 girls came in, and 31 boys left.\n3. To find out how many children were there at first, we need to account for both the girls who came in and the boys who left.\n4. Since we don't have information about the number of girls who were initially present, we can only find the total number of boys.\n5. To find the total number of boys, we subtract the number of boys who left (31) from the total number of boys at the end (since all the girls who came in are girls and not boys).\n6. So, the total number of boys at the end is the initial number of boys plus the number of boys who left but didn't actually leave (since they are still in the bakery).\n7. Therefore, the total number of boys at the end is the initial number of boys + 31 - 31 = initial number of boys.\n8. Since we know the total number of children at the end is 78, and the number of girls who came in is 24, we can find the initial number of boys by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of children at the end: 78 - 24 = 54.\n9.

The total amount of oil is 95 tons.\n2. A large barrel can hold 6 tons of oil, and a small barrel can hold 5 tons of oil.\n3. To minimize the number of barrels, we should use as many large barrels as possible first, since they can hold more oil.\n4. Let L be the number of large barrels and S be the number of small barrels.\n5. Since every barrel should be fully occupied, we have the following equations:\n   - 6L + 5S = 95\n6. We want to minimize L, so we should maximize S. However, S must be less than or equal to 95/5 = 19 (since we can't have a fraction of a barrel).\n7. If we use 19 small barrels, we would have 95 - (19 * 5) = 95 - 95 = 0 tons of oil left, which is not possible.\n8. If we use 18 small barrels, we would have 95 - (18 * 5) = 95 - 90 = 5 tons of oil left.\n9. Since a large barrel can hold 6 tons of oil, we can use 1 large barrel to hold the remaining 5 tons of oil.\n10. Therefore, we should use 16 large barrels (since 16 * 6 = 96 tons, and subtracting the 5 tons from the 96 leaves us with the exact 95 tons of oil).\n11.

To minimize the number of trucks, we should first use large trucks as much as possible.\n4.

First, let's find out how many bureaus each office should get if they are equally distributed. Since there are 88 bureaus for 14 offices, each office should get 88 / 14 = 6.3 bureaus. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a bureau, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7 bureaus per office.\n\n2. Now, let's find out how many bureaus have been distributed so far. Since there are 14 offices and each office has 7 bureaus, a total of 14 * 7 = 98 bureaus have been distributed.\n\n3. Finally, let's find out how many more bureaus are needed. Since there are 88 bureaus in total and 98 bureaus have been distributed, we subtract the distributed bureaus from the total bureaus, which gives us 88 - 98 = -10. However, since we cannot have a negative number of bureaus, we know that we need to add more bureaus. So, we take the absolute value of the difference, which gives us |-10| = 10.\n\n4. Since we rounded up the number of bureaus per office earlier, we actually need 1 more bureau for each office than what we calculated earlier. So, we multiply the number of offices by 1, which gives us 14 * 1 = 14.\n\n5. However, we already added 10 bureaus to account for the difference between the calculated and actual number of bureaus per office. So, we subtract the 10 bureaus we added earlier from the 14 bureaus we just calculated, which gives us 14 - 10 = 4.\n\n6.

How much heavier is a glass bottle than a plastic bottle?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n\nPlease give the final answer in arabic numerals, as 'Therefore, the answer is (5.0).'", 'pred_answer': "First, let's find the weight of one glass bottle and one plastic bottle.\n\nFor 4 glass bottles, the total weight is 4 * (weight of one glass bottle) = 4 * 150g (since the weight of 3 glass bottles is 600g, and we need to find the weight of 4).\n\nFor 5 plastic bottles, the total weight is 5 * (weight of one plastic bottle) = 5 * (1000g - 4 * 150g) (since the total weight of 4 glass bottles and 5 plastic bottles is 1000g + 50g).\n\nNow, let's find the difference in weight between a glass bottle and a plastic bottle.\n\n(Weight of one glass bottle) - (Weight of one plastic bottle) = (4 * 150g) - [5 * (1000g - 4 * 150g)]\n\nSolving this equation will give us the difference in weight.\n\n(4 * 150g) - (5 * 1000g - 20 * 150g) = 600g - 5000g + 3000g = -3400g\n\nSince the weight is given in grams, the negative sign indicates that the plastic bottle is heavier than the glass bottle. To find the difference in weight between a glass bottle and a plastic bottle, we need to take the absolute value of the result.\n\n|-3400g| = 3400g\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3400g or 3.4 kg (since 1 kg = 1000g). However, since the question asks for the difference in weight in terms of the number of bottles, we can divide the result by the weight of one glass bottle (150g) to get the number of glass bottles heavier than one plastic bottle.\n\n3400g / 150g = 22.666666666667 (approximately)\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a bottle, we can round this value to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, a glass bottle is approximately 23 times heavier than a plastic bottle.", 'true_answer': '150 (g)'}

We know that the ratio of good oranges to bad oranges is 3:1.\n2. Let G represent the number of good oranges and B represent the number of bad oranges.\n3. According to the given ratio, we can write the equation: G/B = 3/1\n4. Since there are 24 good oranges in total, we can write another equation: G = 24\n5. Now, we can solve for B by substituting the value of G from the second equation into the first equation: 24/B = 3/1\n6. Cross-multiplying, we get: 24 * B = 3 * 1 * B\n7. Simplifying, we get: 24B = 3B\n8. Solving for B, we find that B = 24 / 3 = 8\n9. However, since there are 24 good oranges in total, and we have already accounted for them, the remaining oranges must be bad. So, the total number of oranges minus the good oranges gives us the number of bad oranges: Total oranges - Good oranges = Bad oranges\n10. Plugging in the values, we get: 24 - 24 = 0, which is incorrect. This means there was an error in our calculations.\n11. Since the total number of oranges is given as 24, and we know that there are 24 good oranges, there must be no bad oranges. However, the ratio given is 3:1, which implies that there should be some bad oranges. This contradiction indicates that the given ratio cannot be correct for the given number of good oranges.\n12. To find the correct ratio, let's assume that there are x bad oranges. The total number of oranges is then 24 + x. The ratio of good to bad oranges is still 3:1, so we can write the equation: (24 + x) / x = 3/1\n13. Cross-multiplying, we get: (24 + x) * x = 3 * (1 * (24 + x))\n14. Simplifying, we get: 24x + x^2 = 72 + 3x\n15. Rearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation, we get: x^2 - 3x - 48 = 0\n16. Factoring the quadratic equation, we find that (x - 12)(x + 4) = 0\n17. Solving for x, we find that x = 12 or x = -4. Since the number of bad oranges cannot be negative, we discard the solution x = -4.\n18. Therefore, the number of bad oranges is x = 12.", 'true_answer': '8 (bad oranges)'}

We know that a lunar cycle is approximately 29.5 days.\n\nSince the last full moon occurred on a Friday, we need to find the next Friday within the next lunar cycle. To do this, we can calculate the number of days from the last full moon to the next Friday and then subtract that number from the total number of days in a lunar cycle.\n\nLet's assume the last full moon occurred on Friday, June 11th. The next Friday would be June 18th. So, the number of days from the last full moon to the next Friday is 7 days (June 18th - June 11th).\n\nNow, let's find the number of days in the next lunar cycle that falls after June 18th. The total number of days in a lunar cycle is approximately 29.5 days, so the number of days in the next lunar cycle that falls after June 18th is:\n\n29.5 days - 7 days = 22.5 days\n\nSince we cannot have half a day, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 23 days.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 23 days. However, since we are looking for the next full moon that falls on a Friday, we need to add the number of days from June 18th to the next Friday (June 25th). So, the total number of days until the next full moon that falls on a Friday is:\n\n23 days (from the last full moon to the next Friday) + 7 days (from June 18th to June 25th) = 30 days\n\nSo, the answer is 30 days.

To find out how many pages he has read in total, we add the initial number of pages he read (37) to the additional pages he read (25).\n5. So, the total number of pages Jake has read is 37 + 25 = 62 pages.\n6. However, since we made an error in our initial calculation, we should subtract the extra 3 pages that Jake read more than the total number of chapters (8).\n7. Therefore, the correct total number of pages Jake has read is 62 - 3 = 59 pages.\n8. Since we made an error in our initial calculation, we should also subtract the extra 6 pages that Jake read more than the actual number of pages in the book (95).\n9.

Evan started with 82 books. Here\'s the reasoning:\n\n1. Evan currently has 60 books.\n2. He gave his best friend 14 books.

However, we know that Evan had a large collection of books. Since we don\'t know what "large" means in this context, let\'s assume that Evan\'s collection is so large that even after giving away 22 books (14 to his best friend and 8 to his little brother), he still has more than 60 books.\n5. To find the original number of books, we can add a reasonable number to the current number of books (60) until we reach a number greater than 66.\n6. If we add 16 books to the current number of books (60 + 16 = 76), we get a number greater than 66. Therefore, the original number of books Evan had is 76 - 22 = 54. However, since we assumed that Evan\'s collection is large, we can add more books to account for the "large" aspect. Let\'s add another 8 books to the original number (54 + 8 = 62). Now, the number of books is still greater than 66.\n7. To find the exact number of books Evan had at first, we can continue adding reasonable numbers until we reach a number greater than 66 but not too large to still be considered a "large" collection. Adding 6 more books (62 + 6 = 68) gives us a number that is still large but not unreasonably large.\n8.

First, convert the distances from centimeters to meters. Since 1 meter equals 100 centimeters, 840 cm is equal to 8.4 meters, and 330 cm is equal to 3.3 meters.\n\n2. To find the total distance traveled by the bee, add the distances: 8.4 meters (from the flower to the hive) + 3.3 meters (from the hive back to the flower) = 11.7 meters.\n\n3. However, since the bee started and ended at the same flower, we should subtract the distance from the hive back to the flower (3.3 meters) from the total distance, as the bee didn't travel that part twice.\n\n4. So, the final answer is the total distance minus the return distance: 11.7 meters - 3.3 meters = 8.4 meters.\n\n5. To express the answer in decimal form, convert the meters to decimeters (since 1 meter equals 10 decimeters), and then convert the decimeters to centimeters (since 1 decimeter equals 10 centimeters). So, 8.4 meters is equal to 84 decimeters, which is equal to 840 centimeters.\n\n6. Therefore, the answer is (8.4).

Since she filled one-fourth of the barrel, that means she filled 1/4 of the barrel.\n\nTo find out how many kilograms of compost Jemma filled on Saturday, we need to know the total capacity of the barrel and the density of the compost. Let's assume the total capacity of the barrel is C kilograms and the density of the compost is D kg/part.\n\nOn Saturday, Jemma filled 1/4 of the barrel, so the amount of compost she added on Saturday is (1/4) * C * D.\n\nOn Sunday, Jemma added 4200 g of compost. To find out the number of parts she filled on Sunday, we can divide the amount of compost she added on Sunday by the density of the compost. Let's call this number P.\n\nP = 4200 g / D\n\nSince the total number of parts filled in the barrel is the sum of the parts filled on Saturday and Sunday, we have:\n\n(1/4) * C + P = 1\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to find the total capacity of the barrel:\n\nC = 4 * (1 - P)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of P. We know that P = 4200 g / D. To find the value of D, we can use the fact that the total amount of compost in the barrel is 5 kg (which we found in the final answer).\n\nThe total amount of compost in the barrel is the sum of the compost Jemma added on Saturday and Sunday:\n\n(1/4) * C * D + 4200 g / D = 5000 g\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to find the value of D:\n\nD^2 - 4200 D - 200000 = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we find that D = 1000 or D = -4200. Since the density of compost cannot be negative, we take D = 1000.\n\nNow, we can find the value of P:\n\nP = 4200 g / 1000 = 4.2\n\nFinally, we can find the total capacity of the barrel:\n\nC = 4 * (1 - 4.2) = 4 * (-3.2) = -12.8 * 1000 = -12800 g = -12.8 kg\n\nSince the capacity of the barrel cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of C:\n\nC = |-12.8| = 12.8 kg\n\nHowever, we made an error in our calculations. The total amount of compost in the barrel should be 5 kg, not 5000 g. This means that our value for the density of the compost is incorrect. Let's try again with a different density.\n\nLet's assume the density of the compost is 500 kg/m^3 (which is a common density for compost). In this case, the amount of compost Jemma added on Saturday is (1/4) * C * (500 kg/m^3) = (1/4) * C * 500.\n\nOn Sunday, Jemma added 4200 g of compost. To find out the number of parts she filled on Sunday, we can divide the amount of compost she added on Sunday by the density of the compost:\n\nP = 4200 g / 500 kg/m^3 = 8.4 m\n\nSince the total number of parts filled in the barrel is the sum of the parts filled on Saturday and Sunday, we have:\n\n(1/4) * C + 8.4 = 1\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to find the total capacity of the barrel:\n\nC = 4 * (1 - 8.4) = 4 * (-7.4) = -29.6 * 1000 = -29600 g = -29.6 kg\n\nSince the capacity of the barrel cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of C:\n\nC = |-29.6| = 29.6 kg\n\nHowever, we made an error in our calculations. The total amount of compost in the barrel should be 5 kg, not 5000 g. This means that our value for the density of the compost is incorrect. Let's try again with a different density.\n\nLet's assume the density of the compost is 50 kg/m^3 (which is a common density for compost). In this case, the amount of compost Jemma added on Saturday is (1/4) * C * (50 kg/m^3) = (1/4) * C * 50.\n\nOn Sunday, Jemma added 4200 g of compost. To find out the number of parts she filled on Sunday, we can divide the amount of compost she added on Sunday by the density of the compost:\n\nP = 4200 g / 50 kg/m^3 = 84 m\n\nSince the total number of parts filled in the barrel is the sum of the parts filled on Saturday and Sunday, we have:\n\n(1/4) * C + 84 = 1\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to find the total capacity of the barrel:\n\nC = 4 * (1 - 84) = 4 * (-83) = -332 * 1000 = -332000 g = -332 kg\n\nSince the capacity of the barrel cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of C:\n\nC = |-332| = 332 kg\n\nNow, we can find the amount of compost Jemma added on Saturday:\n\nAmount of compost on Saturday = (1/4) * C * 50 = (1/4) * 332 * 50 = 83 * 50 = 4150 kg\n\nSince the amount of compost Jemma added on Saturday is in kilograms, we can convert the remaining space filled with 4200 g of compost on Sunday to kilograms:\n\nAmount of compost on Sunday = 4200 g / 1000 = 4.2 kg\n\nNow, we can find the total amount of compost in the barrel:\n\nTotal amount of compost = Amount of compost on Saturday + Amount of compost on Sunday = 4150 kg + 4.2 kg = 4154.2 kg\n\nSince the total amount of compost in the barrel should be 5 kg, we made an error in our calculations. Let's try again with a different density.\n\nLet's assume the density of the compost is 5000 kg/m^3 (which is a common density for compost). In this case, the amount of compost Jemma added on Saturday is (1/4) * C * (5000 kg/m^3) = (1/4) * C * 5000.\n\nOn Sunday, Jemma added 4200 g of compost. To find out the number of parts she filled on Sunday, we can divide the amount of compost she added on Sunday by the density of the compost:\n\nP = 4200 g / 5000 kg/m^3 = 0.84 m\n\nSince the total number of parts filled in the barrel is the sum of the parts filled on Saturday and Sunday, we have:\n\n(1/4) * C + 0.84 = 1\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to find the total capacity of the barrel:\n\nC = 4 * (1 - 0.84) = 4 * 0.16 = 0.64 * 1000 = 640 kg\n\nSince the capacity of the barrel cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of C:\n\nC = |-640| = 640 kg\n\nNow, we can find the amount of compost Jemma added on Saturday:\n\nAmount of compost on Saturday = (1/4) * C * 5000 = (1/4) * 640 * 5000 = 640 * 5000 = 3200000 g = 3200 kg\n\nSince the amount of compost Jemma added on Saturday is in kilograms, we can convert the remaining space filled with 4200 g of compost on Sunday to kilograms:\n\nAmount of compost on Sunday = 4200 g / 1000 =", 'true_answer': '5.6 (kilograms of compost)'}

Ten years ago, the sum of the sons' ages was one-third of the father's age. So, we have the equation: O(t) + Y(t) = (1/3)F(t-10), where O(t) and Y(t) are the sons' ages at time t, and F(t-10) is the father's age ten years ago.\n\n2. The older son is two years older than the younger son, so Y(t) = O(t) - 2.\n\n3. The sum of the sons' present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age. So, we have the equation: O(t) + Y(t) = F(t) - 14.\n\n4. Now we have two equations with two variables, but we have an additional piece of information: the difference between the sons' ages is constant, so O(t) - Y(t) = 2 for all t.\n\n5. We can solve this system of equations. First, substitute Y(t) = O(t) - 2 into the first equation: O(t) + (O(t) - 2) = (1/3)F(t-10). Solving for O(t), we get O(t) = (2 + (1/3)F(t-10))/2.\n\n6. Now substitute O(t) into the second equation: (2 + (1/3)F(t-10))/2 + (2 + (1/3)F(t-10))/2 - 2 = F(t) - 14. Solving for F(t), we get F(t) = 2 + (1/3)(t-10) + 14.\n\n7. To find the present ages, we set t = now and solve for F, O, and Y. F(now) = 2 + (1/3)(now-10) + 14. Solving for now, we get now = 10 + 3(F(now) - 14 - 2).\n\n8. Substitute F(now) back into the equation, we get now = 10 + 3(F(now) - 16). Solving for F(now), we get F(now) = (16 + 3now + 10)/3.\n\n9. Since the father's age is a positive integer, we can test different values of now to find the integer solution for F(now). For example, if now = 40, then F(now) = 50, which is not a valid solution because it's not a multiple of 3. If now = 43, then F(now) = 52, which is a valid solution because it's a multiple of 3.\n\n10. Substitute F(now) = 52 back into the equation F(now) = 2 + (1/3)(now-10) + 14, we get now = 43.\n\n11. Now we can find the sons' ages. O(now) = (2 + (1/3)(43-10) + 14)/2 = 22.5 ≈ 23 (rounding up since the ages are integers). Y(now) = O(now) - 2 = 23 - 2 = 21.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Father's age = 52, Older son's age = 23, and Younger son's age = 21.", 'true_answer': '21 (years old)'}

So, the sum of the length and the width is 80 meters divided by 2, which equals 40 meters.\n4. Since we know the length (25 meters), we can find the width by subtracting the length from the sum of the length and width: 40 - 25 = 15 meters.\n5. However, since the width must be a positive value, we need to consider that the fencing was placed around the garden, meaning it encloses the garden on all sides. Therefore, the actual width of the garden is half of the calculated width: 15 / 2 = 7.5 meters.

If we divide this by 2 (since there are two shorter sides), we get 27.5 meters for each shorter side.

What is the area of the border?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n\nPlease give the final answer in arabic numerals, as 'Therefore, the answer is (5.0).'", 'pred_answer': "Therefore, the answer is (80).\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. First, find the dimensions of the living room with the border included. Since there is a 2-foot border on each side, the actual dimensions of the room are 12 + 4 = 16 feet in length and 10 + 4 = 14 feet in width.\n\n2. Calculate the area of the living room with the border included: 16 * 14 = 224 square feet.\n\n3. Now, find the dimensions of the carpet itself (without the border). Subtract the border width from both the length and the width: 12 - 4 = 8 feet in length and 10 - 4 = 6 feet in width.\n\n4. Calculate the area of the carpet: 8 * 6 = 48 square feet.\n\n5. Finally, find the area of the border by subtracting the area of the carpet from the area of the room with the border included: 224 - 48 = 176 square feet.\n\n6. However, since the border is all around the room, we need to account for the border on the diagonals as well. There are 4 sides to the room, so there are 2 diagonals. Each diagonal has a length of sqrt((16^2) + (14^2)) = sqrt(256 + 196) = sqrt(452) ≈ 21.26 feet.\n\n7. The area of each diagonal border is (21.26 * 21.26) / 2 ≈ 460.32 square feet.\n\n8. Since there are 2 diagonal borders, the total area of the border is 460.32 * 2 ≈ 920.64 square feet.\n\n9. However, we made a mistake in our initial calculation of the area of the room with the border included. We should have used the actual dimensions of the room with the border included (16 * 14 = 224 square feet) instead of the dimensions of the carpet (8 * 6 = 48 square feet). So, the total area of the border is 224 - 48 = 176 square feet.\n\n10. Since the border area we calculated earlier (920.64 square feet) includes the area of the diagonal borders twice, we need to subtract the area of the diagonal borders from our initial calculation: 920.64 - 2 * (sqrt(452) * sqrt(452)) / 2 ≈ 920.64 - 460.32 ≈ 460.32 square feet.\n\n11. But we made another mistake in our initial calculation of the area of the diagonal borders. The area of each diagonal border should be (21.26 * 21.26) = 460.32 square feet, not (21.26 * 21.26) / 2. So, the total area of the border is 460.32 square feet.\n\n12. However, we made a mistake in our initial calculation of the area of the carpet. We should have used the actual dimensions of the carpet (8 * 6 = 48 square feet) instead of the dimensions of the room without the border included (12 * 10 = 120 square feet). So, the total area of the border is 224 - 48 = 176 square feet.\n\n13. Since our previous calculations of the border area were incorrect, we will stick with the correct calculation of the area of the carpet (8 * 6 = 48 square feet) and subtract it from the area of the room with the border included (16 * 14 = 224 square feet): 224 - 48 = 176 square feet.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 176 square feet.", 'true_answer': '72 (square feet)'}

What is the area of the rectangle?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n\nPlease give the final answer in arabic numerals, as 'Therefore, the answer is (5.0).'", 'pred_answer': "First, let's find the perimeter of the square. Since it's a square, all sides have equal length. So, the perimeter is 4 * side length = 4 * 15 cm = 60 cm.\n\nNow, let's denote the width of the rectangle as w and the length as l. Since the perimeter of the rectangle is also 60 cm, we can write the equation: 2l + 2w = 60.\n\nWe know that the area of the rectangle is length * width, so let's denote the area as A. We want to find A in terms of the known perimeter.\n\nSince the perimeter of the square equals the perimeter of the rectangle, we can write another equation: 4 * side length = 2l + 2w. Substitute the side length from the first equation into the second equation: 4 * 15 = 2l + 2w => 60 = 2l + 2w.\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables:\n\n1. 2l + 2w = 60\n2. A = l * w\n\nWe can solve the first equation for one variable, say w: w = (60 - 2l) / 2.\n\nNow, substitute this expression for w into the second equation: A = l * ((60 - 2l) / 2).\n\nTo find the area, we need to find the value of l that satisfies this equation. Solving this quadratic equation might be a bit complex, but we can use trial and error or a more advanced method like completing the square to find the solution.\n\nLet's use trial and error. If we try l = 9, we get w = (60 - 2 * 9) / 2 = 24 / 2 = 12. The area would be A = 9 * 12 = 108. However, this area is too large for a rectangle with a perimeter of 60 cm.\n\nIf we try l = 6, we get w = (60 - 2 * 6) / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24. The area would be A = 6 * 24 = 144. This area is also too large.\n\nIf we try l = 3, we get w = (60 - 2 * 3) / 2 = 54 / 2 = 27. The area would be A = 3 * 27 = 81. This area is still too large.\n\nIf we try l = 2, we get w = (60 - 2 * 2) / 2 = 56 / 2 = 28. The area would be A = 2 * 28 = 56. This area is close to the perimeter, but it's still too large.\n\nIf we try l = 1, we get w = (60 - 2 * 1) / 2 = 58 / 2 = 29. The area would be A = 1 * 29 = 29. This area is too small.\n\nIf we try l = 4, we get w = (60 - 2 * 4) / 2 = 52 / 2 = 26. The area would be A = 4 * 26 = 104. This area is close to the perimeter, but it's still too large.\n\nIf we try l = 5, we get w = (60 - 2 * 5) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25. The area would be A = 5 * 25 = 125. This area is larger than the perimeter, so it's not possible.\n\nSince we've tried all the possible values for l, we can conclude that there is no solution for the given conditions. The perimeter of a square cannot be equal to the perimeter of a rectangle with integer dimensions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'No solution.'", 'true_answer': '216 (square cm)'}

To find the difference in distance, subtract the canoeing distance from the walking distance: 6.28 - 2 = 4.28 miles.\n\n5. However, since we are looking for the shorter distance, we should consider that when canoeing, Chad doesn't have to travel the entire circumference of the lake.

The other leg will be the base 'b'.\n\nb² + h² = c²\nb² + (2.4)² = (6)²\nb² + 5.76 = 36\nb² = 36 - 5.76\nb² = 30.24\nb = sqrt(30.24) ≈ 5.5 cm\n\nFinally, we can calculate the area of the triangle using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 5.5 cm * 2.4 cm = 6.6 cm²\n\nTherefore, the answer is 6.6.", 'true_answer': '60 (square cm)'}

Now, multiply the cost per bag by the number of bags we want: $2.94 * 4 = $11.76 (cost for 4 bags).\n5. However, since the price is given in dollars and cents, we need to round the cost to the nearest cent. In this case, $11.76 becomes $11.75.\n6. But since the question asks for the cost in Arabic numerals, we don't need to write the dollar sign. So the final answer is 7.35.", 'true_answer': '11.76 (dollars)'}

Since Tayli gave out the same number of red and blue flyers, we have R = B.\n\nRed flyers were given to restaurant owners, and each pack contains 13 flyers. So, the total number of red flyers given to restaurant owners is 13R.\n\nBlue flyers were given to clothing store owners, and each set contains 20 flyers. So, the total number of blue flyers given to clothing store owners is 20B.\n\nSince Tayli gave out the same number of red and blue flyers, we can write the equation:\n\n13R + 20B = Total number of flyers\n\nSince R = B, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n13(R) + 20(R) = Total number of flyers\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n\n33R = Total number of flyers\n\nNow, we need to find the minimum number of flyers that satisfy this equation. To do this, we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 20, which is 65.

Since they started at the same time, we can consider the time it takes for P to run 198 rounds (Q's rounds per 252 seconds) and for Q to run 252 rounds (P's rounds per 198 seconds).\n\nFor P to run 198 rounds, the time will be 198 * 252 = 49,808 seconds.\n\nFor Q to run 252 rounds, the time will be 252 * 498 = 125,376 seconds.\n\nNow, we add these two times together to find the total time: 49,808 + 125,376 = 175,184 seconds.\n\nFinally, we convert this time from seconds to minutes and seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide the total number of seconds by 60 to get the number of minutes: 175,184 / 60 = 2,919.733333333333 minutes.\n\nSince there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can find the remaining seconds by multiplying the decimal part by 60: 0.7333333333333333 * 60 = 43.999999999999996 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (2,919.74) minutes or (2,919 minutes and 44 seconds).", 'true_answer': '2772 (seconds)'}

Let's denote the number of eggs as n.\n\n1. If we count eggs in groups of 2, the total number of groups is n/2 (since we can't have a fraction of a group).\n2. If we count eggs in groups of 3, the total number of groups is (n-2)/3 (since we subtract 2 from n to avoid counting a group of 2 twice).\n3. If we count eggs in groups of 4, the total number of groups is (n-2-3)/4.\n4. If we count eggs in groups of 5, the total number of groups is (n-2-3-4)/5.\n\nSince there are no eggs left over, the sum of the number of groups for each case should be equal to the total number of groups minus one (since we subtract one group from the total to account for the final count of all remaining eggs).\n\nSo, we have the following equation:\n\n(n/2) + ((n-2)/3) + ((n-2-3)/4) + ((n-2-3-4)/5) = n - 1\n\nSolving this equation is quite complex and may require numerical methods or a computer program. However, since the number of eggs is less than 6 dozen (72), we can try to find a solution by trial and error.\n\nBy testing different values of n, we find that when n = 56, the equation holds true:\n\n(56/2) + (54/3) + (52/4) + (48/5) = 55\n\nTherefore, the answer is 56 eggs.

So, (68 - 28) / 8 = 36 / 8 = 4.5, which means there were 5 players (since we can't have half a player). However, since Faye is also included in the team, we add 1 to the result, giving us a total of 7 players on Faye's team.", 'true_answer': '5 (players)'}

Since each table holds three people, and 50 people didn't show up, we need to find out how many groups of three are in 50. To do this, we divide 50 by 3, which gives us 16 with a remainder of 2. Since we can't have a fraction of a table, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 17 groups of three. As each table can seat three people, we multiply the number of groups by the number of people per group, which gives us 17 * 3 = 51. However, since we've already accounted for the 50 people who didn't show up, we subtract the 50 from the total number of seats available, which gives us 51 - 50 = 1.

Sean had 45 Starbursts.\n2. He gave equal numbers of Starbursts to his 18 friends.\n3. Let's find out how many Starbursts he gave to each friend by dividing the total number of Starbursts by the number of friends: 45 / 18 = 2.5 (rounded down to 2 since you can't divide a whole Starburst).\n4. So, Sean gave 2 Starbursts to each of his 18 friends, which means he gave away a total of 2 * 18 = 36 Starbursts.\n5. Now, we subtract the number of Starbursts he gave away from the total number he had: 45 - 36 = 9 Starbursts.\n6. Since Sean ate what was left, each person effectively ate 9 Starbursts divided by the number of friends (excluding Sean): 9 / (18 - 1) = 9 / 17 ≈ 0.529 (rounded down to 0 since you can't eat a fraction of a Starburst).\n7. However, since Sean already ate some Starbursts, we need to find out how many Starbursts each friend effectively ate after Sean's initial distribution and his own eating.\n8. To do that, we subtract the number of Starbursts Sean gave away from the number of Starbursts each friend effectively ate: 0 - 2 = -2.\n9. Since it's not possible to have a negative number of Starbursts, we know that the number of Starbursts each friend effectively ate after Sean's initial distribution and his own eating is 0.\n10. Therefore, each person effectively ate 0 Starbursts. However, since Sean ate 9 Starbursts, we can say that each person effectively ate 9 / 18 = 0.5 Starbursts.\n11.

Since it's not possible to divide cookies among friends in decimal numbers, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, each friend will get 1804 / 82 = 22.02 cookies. Since we can't give a fraction of a cookie, each friend will get 22 cookies.", 'true_answer': '22 (cookies)'}
{'question': 'Keith has 5530 marbles and 3 pencils. If he shares the marbles among 79 friends, how many marbles does each friend get?', 'idx': 2213, 'prompt': "Question: Keith has 5530 marbles and 3 pencils. If he shares the marbles among 79 friends, how many marbles does each friend get?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n\nPlease give the final answer in arabic numerals, as 'Therefore, the answer is (5.0).'", 'pred_answer': 'Therefore, the answer is (5530 / 79). This means that each friend gets approximately 69 marbles, rounded down to the nearest whole number. However, since the question asks for the exact number, we should use long division or a calculator to find the exact quotient, which is approximately 69.95 marbles per friend. Since we cannot divide marbles into a fraction, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 69 marbles per friend. So, the final answer is 69 marbles per friend.', 'true_answer': '70 (marbles)'}
{'question': 'There are 43 students and 1720 apples. Each student has 9 Skittles. If the apples are divided equally among the students, how many does each student get?', 'idx': 2214, 'prompt': "Question: There are 43 students and 1720 apples. Each student has 9 Skittles. If the apples are divided equally among the students, how many does each student get?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n\nPlease give the final answer in arabic numerals, as 'Therefore, the answer is (5.0).'", 'pred_answer': "Therefore, the answer is (36.5).\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find out how many apples each student gets if they are divided equally among the students. To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of students: 1720 apples / 43 students = 40 apples per student (approximately).\n\n2. However, we also know that each student has 9 Skittles. Since apples and Skittles are not related, we cannot use the number of Skittles to determine the number of apples.\n\n3. The question asks for the number of apples each student gets if the apples are divided equally among the students. Since there are 43 students and approximately 40 apples per student, the total number of apples should be around 43 * 40 = 1720 apples.\n\n4. Since the total number of apples is already given as 1720, each student gets approximately 1720 apples / 43 students = 36.5 apples (approximately).\n\n5. However, it's important to note that it's not possible for each student to get a fraction of an apple. This calculation is based on the assumption that the apples can be divided exactly, which is not always possible in real life.\n\n6. In a real-world scenario, the apples might need to be distributed in a way that ensures each student gets at least one apple, but not necessarily the exact number calculated above.\n\n7. Therefore, the answer is (36.5), but it's important to keep in mind that this is an approximation and the actual number of apples each student gets may vary.", 'true_answer': '40 (apples)'}
