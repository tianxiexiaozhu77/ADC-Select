Jemma filled one-fourth of the barrel with compost on Saturday. This means that \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the barrel is filled on Saturday.\\n\\n2. On Sunday, she filled the remaining space in the barrel with 4200 g of compost. Since one-fourth of the barrel is already filled, three-fourths of the barrel was empty before Sunday.\\n\\n3. The amount of compost she added on Sunday (4200 g) filled the remaining three-fourths of the barrel. Therefore, the amount of compost in three-fourths of the barrel is 4200 g.\\n\\n4. To find out how much compost is in the entire barrel, we first find out how much compost corresponds to one-fourth of the barrel. Since three-fourths equals 4200 g, one-fourth can be calculated as follows:\\n\\n   \\[\\n   \\text{One-fourth quantity} = \\frac{4200 \\text{ g}}{3} = 1400 \\text{ g}\\n   \\]\\n\\n5. Now, we can determine the total amount of compost in the barrel by adding the amount filled on Saturday (one-fourth) and the amount filled on Sunday (three-fourths):\\n\\n   \\[\\n   \\text{Total compost} = \\text{One-fourth} + \\text{Three-fourths} = 1400 \\text{ g} + 4200 \\text{ g} = 5600 \\text{ g}\\n   \\]\\n\\n6. Finally, we need to convert grams to kilograms. Since there are 1000 grams in a kilogram:\\n\\n   \\[\\n   \\text{Total compost in kilograms} = \\frac{5600 \\text{ g}}{1000} = 5.6 \\text{ kg}\\n   \\]\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is (5.6).", 'true_answer': '5.6 (kilograms of compost)'}
