Q: Miranda and Savannah are excited that a new store just opened in town! They go together the first day it opens! Each time Miranda goes to the store she plans to spend $7, and each time Savannah goes to the store she plans to spend $9. A few weeks from now, Miranda and Savannah are surprised to find out that they have spent the exact same total amount of money at the store. What is the least possible number of times that Miranda has been to the store?
A: Let's think step by step. 
Let M be the number of times Miranda goes to the store, and S be the number of times Savannah goes. The total amount spent by Miranda is 7M dollars and the total amount spent by Savannah is 9S dollars. We are looking for the smallest M such that 7M = 9S. Rearranging this gives us M/S = 9/7, meaning that for every 9 trips Savannah makes, Miranda makes 7 trips. To find integer solutions for M and S, we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 9. The LCM of 7 and 9 is 63. To find the number of times they each go to the store, we divide the LCM by their spending habits: M = 63/7 = 9 trips for Miranda, and S = 63/9 = 7 trips for Savannah. Thus, the least number of trips Miranda has made to the store for them to have spent equal amounts is 9 times.
Therefore, the answer is (9 (times))


Q: It's New Year's Eve. Benjamin and his family went to New York City to take part in the celebration that is going to take place later that night. Before the evening celebrations, Benjamin wanted to see some of the famous places in NYC first. From the hotel, he walked 234 steps to the nearest restaurant then another 378 steps to Central Park. How many steps did he take to get to Central Park from the hotel?
A: Let's think step by step. 
First, we need to determine the total number of steps Benjamin took from the hotel to Central Park. He first walked 234 steps to the nearest restaurant and then walked an additional 378 steps to reach Central Park. To find the total steps taken, we add the two distances together: 234 steps + 378 steps = 612 steps. Therefore, Benjamin took 612 steps to get to Central Park from the hotel.
Therefore, the answer is (612 (steps))


Q: It is Buddy's first day at a new school and he is feeling very nervous. His day begins with some bacon and egg prepared by his mother. After eating and preparing, Buddy headed out to catch the school bus from the nearest bus stop. Including Buddy, there were 39 students that got on the bus during the first stop. If 29 more students got on the bus at the second stop, how many students are riding the bus?
A: Let's think step by step. 
Buddy is the first student to get on the bus, making a total of 1 student. There are 39 students that got on the bus during the first stop, which includes Buddy. Therefore, the total number of students on the bus after the first stop is 39. At the second stop, 29 more students get on the bus. To find the total number of students riding the bus after the second stop, we add the students from both stops: 39 + 29 = 68.
Therefore, the answer is (68 (students))


Q: Lizzie lives in a very big and polluted city. Being an advocate for the environment, she organized a cleanup drive to help reduce the pollution. They started by cleaning the rivers that flow through and around the city. If her group was able to collect 387 pounds of garbage and another group gathered 39 pounds less than Lizzie's group, how much garbage were the two groups able to gather?
A: Let's think step by step. 
First, we calculate how much garbage the second group collected. Since Lizzie's group collected 387 pounds and the other group gathered 39 pounds less, we subtract 39 from 387. This gives us: 387 - 39 = 348 pounds. Now, we need to find the total amount of garbage collected by both groups. We do this by adding the amounts they gathered together: 387 + 348 = 735 pounds. Therefore, the total amount of garbage collected by both groups is 735 pounds.
Therefore, the answer is (735 (pounds))


Q: Alicia loves collecting art. She has a whole house filled with all the art she obtained since she was a little kid. When she decided to move away, she started donating some of her art to different museums. First museum she went to was the Metropolitan museum in New York. She donated 46 medieval art pieces from the 70 she originally has. How many medieval art pieces were left with her?
A: Let's think step by step. 
Alicia originally has 70 medieval art pieces. She donated 46 medieval art pieces to the Metropolitan Museum in New York. To find out how many medieval art pieces she has left, we subtract the number of pieces she donated from the original total. This can be calculated as follows: 70 - 46 = 24. Therefore, Alicia has 24 medieval art pieces left.
Therefore, the answer is (24 (medieval art pieces))


Q: It's spring break at Rosewood High so Rachel and her family decided to take a trip across Europe. Since Rachel has always been fascinated by the French people, they began their tour with a visit to France. During their stay there, Rachel went to the famous Eiffel Tower. If she climbed 567 flights of stairs going up and 325 going down, what is the total number of steps that she took?
A: Let's think step by step. 
To find the total number of steps that Rachel took, we need to add the number of steps she took going up the stairs to the number of steps she took going down. She climbed 567 flights of stairs going up and descended 325 flights of stairs going down. Therefore, the total number of steps is calculated as 567 (going up) + 325 (going down). Performing the addition: 567 + 325 = 892. Hence, Rachel took a total of 892 steps.
Therefore, the answer is (892 (steps))


Q: Robyn and Lucy are members of their village's Girl Scout troop. During weekends and some weekdays, they go around selling cookies in the neighborhood. They have a week before the month ends and they are doing their best to get a badge from selling cookies. Working overtime, Robyn sold 47 packs of cookies while Lucy sold 29. How many packs of cookies were they able to sell that day?
A: Let's think step by step. 
To find the total number of packs of cookies sold by Robyn and Lucy, we need to add together the number of packs each girl sold. Robyn sold 47 packs, and Lucy sold 29 packs. The calculation can be set up as follows: 47 (Robyn's sales) + 29 (Lucy's sales) = total packs sold. Performing the addition: 47 + 29 equals 76. Therefore, the total number of packs sold that day is 76.
Therefore, the answer is (76 (packs of cookies))


Q: Denver the Dog is a famous architect in the city of Animapolis. Together with his engineer friend Wally the Wolf, they decided to build the tallest building ever, the Animus Tower. To make sure the framework of the tower is strongly built, they hired the best builders in town. If they hired 318 beavers and 544 spiders, how many workers in total did they hire to make the framework?
A: Let's think step by step. 
To find the total number of workers hired, we need to add the number of beavers hired and the number of spiders hired together. We are given that 318 beavers were hired and 544 spiders were hired. We will perform the addition: 318 + 544. First, we can break it down: 300 + 500 = 800, and then 18 + 44 = 62. Now, adding 800 and 62 gives us a total of 862 workers. Therefore, the total number of workers hired for the framework is 862.
Therefore, the answer is (862 (workers))
