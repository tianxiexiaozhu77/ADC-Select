{"question": "Mia discovered 50 marbles in her backyard. She gave Alex some of her marbles. Now she has 20 marbles left. How many marbles did she give to Alex?", "cot": "Mia originally had 50 marbles. After giving some to Alex, she has 20 marbles left. To find out how many marbles she gave to Alex, we can set up the equation: 50 (original marbles) - X (marbles given to Alex) = 20 (marbles left). Solving for X gives us: 50 - X = 20. Rearranging this, we find X = 50 - 20, which calculates to 30. Therefore, Mia gave Alex 30 marbles.", "answer": "Therefore, the answer is (30).", "score": 5.456813942382393}
