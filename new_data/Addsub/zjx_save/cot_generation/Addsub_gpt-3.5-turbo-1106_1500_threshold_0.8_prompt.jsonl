She was present at 8 performances last year. How many theater performances did Sara attend in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of theater performances Sara attended, we need to sum her attendance from this year and last year. This year, Sara attended 30 performances but missed 28. Therefore, we can calculate the number of performances this year by subtracting the missed performances from the total performances: 30 - 28 = 2 performances attended this year. Last year, she attended 8 performances. Now, we sum the performances from this year and last year: 2 (this year) + 8 (last year) = 10 performances. Therefore, the total number of theater performances Sara attended is 10.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\n\nQ: Julia's volleyball squad competed in 20 games this year.

How many matches did they win?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMichael's soccer team played a total of 16 matches this season. Since they lost 5 matches, we can calculate the number of matches they won by subtracting the number of lost matches from the total matches played. Therefore, the number of matches won is 16 (total matches) - 5 (lost matches) = 11. Additionally, since the problem states that they won the majority of their matches, this confirms that they won more than half of the 16 matches, which is true since half of 16 is 8, and 11 is greater than 8. Hence, they indeed won the majority of their matches. \nTherefore, the answer is (11)\n\n\n"}

She sold 2 to a local farmer and gave away 1 to a friend. She now has 4 kids. How many kids did she have to start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the initial number of kids Emily had be x. After selling 2 kids and giving away 1 kid, she has x - 2 - 1 kids left. This simplifies to x - 3. We know that after these transactions, she has 4 kids remaining. Therefore, we can set up the equation x - 3 = 4. To find x, we can add 3 to both sides of the equation: x = 4 + 3. This gives us x = 7. Therefore, Emily started with 7 kids.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\n\nQ: Sophia gathered 80 flowers from the garden. She gave some to her friend Mia. She now has 33 flowers left.

To find out how many lemons Emma bought, we can set up a simple equation: Let x be the number of lemons Emma bought. So, we have: 5 (original lemons) + x (lemons bought) = 20 (total lemons). Solving for x gives: x = 20 - 5 = 15. Therefore, Emma bought 15 lemons.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\n\nQ: Sophia's pig had piglets. She gave away 4 piglets to friends. She has 5 piglets left. How many piglets did she start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet's denote the number of piglets Sophia started with as P. She gave away 4 piglets, so the number of piglets remaining after giving them away is P - 4. We know that she has 5 piglets left. Thus, we can formulate the equation: P - 4 = 5. To find the value of P, we can add 4 to both sides of the equation: P = 5 + 4. Therefore, P = 9. This means Sophia started with 9 piglets.\nTherefore, the answer is (9)\n\n\n"}

Each day, 1 turtle eats 0.25 cup of turtle food and another turtle eats 0.15 cup. Together, how much turtle food do the 6 turtles eat each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the amount of food eaten by one turtle per day. One turtle eats 0.25 cups, and another turtle eats 0.15 cups. We can find the total food eaten by the two turtles by adding their food consumption: 0.25 + 0.15 = 0.40 cups per day for two turtles. Next, since there are 6 turtles in total, we need to determine how many pairs of two turtles we can form or use the total amount eaters directly if they eat differently. In this case, we have 6 turtles, but we only know the food consumption for 2 types of turtles. If all turtles consume the same amounts, we would multiply the average food consumed by the number of turtles. Since we do not have uniform eating habits for all turtles, we\u2019ll simply consider the daily total consumption as given. Therefore, all 6 turtles' eating needs are summarized by the known amounts consumed by the two turtles and calculated based on a typical assumption if mixed habits are noticed, or we can single out specific numbers. In this case, we will conclude with the constant generated sum based on average feeding of these specific two turtles. Thus, in summary, the daily consumption of food for the turtles is represented by multiplying the feeding for the known daily consumption by the count of every typical producer if not all were clear. Hence, we can state with universal clarity that these are the regular portions for similar populations and yield shark outputs equationally represented by their means together. So, compounded over their unit count of 6, the answer can culminate at a final value: 6 turtles could efficiently represent, for clear calculations, direct consumables rounded up to either close 0.40 cups per two taken with averages till we need comparison; essentially getting us to average out, guiding these totals rounded logically convinced by 1 turtle feeding off daily would granting us round figures profiled with how they equate towards better analytical multiplication methods confirming totals above or round approximating counts, as ratio stands as indicative till clean outputs yielded.

The first rabbit eats 0.3 cups of pellets per day, while the second rabbit eats 0.2 cups of pellets per day. We can add these two quantities together to get the total daily consumption of rabbit food. Therefore, we have: Total food = 0.3 cups + 0.2 cups = 0.5 cups.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.5).)\n\n\nQ: Mia owns 4 birds. Every day, 1 bird consumes 0.05 pound of birdseed and another bird consumes 0.1 pound.

One bird consumes 0.05 pound of birdseed while another bird consumes 0.1 pound. Therefore, together, one bird that consumes 0.05 pound and one bird that consumes 0.1 pound will consume 0.05 + 0.1 = 0.15 pounds per day. Since Mia has 4 birds, and we assume there are two of each type, the total daily consumption can be calculated by multiplying the daily consumption of one pair of birds (0.15 pounds) by 2 because there are two pairs (totaling 4 birds). Therefore, the total daily consumption is 0.15 * 2 = 0.30 pounds.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.3).)\n\n\nQ: Laura went to a pet store on Tuesday to buy supplies for her dog.

The first hamster consumes 0.1 cup of food daily, and the second hamster eats 0.15 cup daily. We will calculate the total food consumption of these two hamsters first. 0.1 cup + 0.15 cup = 0.25 cup for the two hamsters. Since there are three hamsters in total, we need to account for the food the third hamster eats as well. However, we don't have information on the consumption of the third hamster. Therefore, we will not include it in our total calculation, meaning we can only determine the total food eaten by the first two hamsters. Therefore, the contribution of the third hamster remains unknown. Hence, the total for the two known hamsters is 0.25 cup, and without additional information about the third hamster, we cannot determine the overall total food consumption for the three hamsters. Since the question only asked for the food eaten by the 3 hamsters together, we assume the third hamster's consumption is negligible or not considered.

Now that Emily has adopted a third guinea pig, she needs to serve a total of 0.8 kg each day. How much extra food is needed to feed the third guinea pig?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Emily had 2 guinea pigs and fed them a total of 0.5 kg of food daily. This means each guinea pig consumed 0.5 kg / 2 = 0.25 kg per day. After adopting a third guinea pig, her total daily food requirement increased to 0.8 kg. We need to determine how much food the third guinea pig requires. First, the amount of food required for 3 guinea pigs is 0.8 kg, which means each guinea pig's share is 0.8 kg / 3 = approximately 0.267 kg per guinea pig. The extra food needed for the third guinea pig compared to when there were only 2 guinea pigs is 0.267 kg - 0.25 kg = approximately 0.017 kg.

Now that Lisa has adopted a third dog, she needs to serve a total of 1.5 cans each day. How much extra food is needed to feed the third dog?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Lisa had 2 dogs and served 1.0 can of dog food per day. This means that each dog was receiving 1.0 / 2 = 0.5 cans per day. After adopting a third dog, the total daily requirement increased to 1.5 cans. To determine how much extra food is needed for the third dog, we first find out how much food each dog receives with the new total. With 3 dogs, the food amount per dog becomes 1.5 / 3 = 0.5 cans per dog, which is the same as before. Therefore, the third dog does not require any additional food beyond what was already being served to each of the other two dogs. Lisa needed to add an additional 0.5 cans to her total to accommodate for the third dog, but because each individual dog is now receiving 0.5 cans, there is no further increase per dog from the previous amount for the other two dogs. Thus, the extra food needed specifically for the third dog itself is 0.5 cans since this is what contributes to the overall increase in food. However, per dog, they all get equal amounts.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.5).)\n\n\nQ: Before serving the customers, a bartender checks the stock of whiskey.

According to the information provided, Mark bought a guitar for $200.20 and a playbook for $14.99. However, we need to determine whether the guitar was purchased from the music store or if it is implied that he only purchased the playbook from the theater group.

Peter took care of 60 apples, Hannah grew 22 apples, and Jacob tended to 18 apples. Therefore, we calculate: 60 (Peter) + 22 (Hannah) + 18 (Jacob) = 100. The duration of their work (25 days) doesn't affect the total count of apples, as we are only interested in the quantity harvested. Thus, the total count of apples harvested is 100.\nTherefore, the answer is (100)\n\n\nQ: Michael cultivated 15 tomatoes, Sarah harvested 28 tomatoes, and James grew 37 tomatoes.

{"idx": 367, "prompt": "Q: Daniel had baseball cards. He traded 4 with his friends. He now has 12 baseball cards left. How many baseball cards did he have at the beginning?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many baseball cards Daniel had initially, we start from the information given. After trading 4 baseball cards with his friends, he has 12 left. We can express this situation with the equation: Initial number of baseball cards - 4 (the number he traded) = 12 (the number he has now). We can set this up as: x - 4 = 12. To find x, we need to add 4 to both sides of the equation: x - 4 + 4 = 12 + 4, which simplifies to x = 16. Therefore, Daniel had 16 baseball cards at the beginning.\nTherefore, the answer is (16)\n\n\nQ: Lucas found 100 cards and 15 envelopes in his attic. He sold some cards at a garage sale.

To find out how many cherries she collected, we can subtract the initial number of cherries from the total number of cherries she has now. Thus, we perform the calculation: 45 (total cherries) - 18 (initial cherries) = 27 (cherries collected).\nTherefore, the answer is (27)\n\n\nQ: Nina had 22 postcards, and 6 were torn. Oliver gave Nina 14 new postcards. Nina bought 18 postcards. How many postcards does Nina have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nNina initially had 22 postcards. However, 6 were torn, so we need to subtract these from the total. Therefore, she has 22 - 6 = 16 postcards remaining. Then, Oliver gave her 14 new postcards, so we add these to her remaining postcards: 16 + 14 = 30 postcards. Finally, Nina bought 18 more postcards, which we also add: 30 + 18 = 48 postcards. Thus, the total number of postcards Nina has now is 48.\nTherefore, the answer is (48)\n\n\nQ: Emily collected 22 stamps and Michael collected 36 stamps for their collection. After sorting, they discovered that 10 were damaged.

Emily collected 22 stamps and Michael collected 36 stamps. To find the total, we add these two amounts together: 22 + 36 = 58. Next, we note that 10 of these stamps were damaged. However, the question asks for the total number of stamps gathered, not considering the condition of the stamps. Thus, we only need the sum of the stamps collected by Emily and Michael. Therefore, the answer is the total number of stamps collected, which is 58.\nTherefore, the answer is (58)\n\n\nQ: Jake started with 200 trading cards, and 15 were scratched. Tom took 50 of Jake's trading cards. How many cards does Jake possess now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nJake started with 200 trading cards. Then, we account for the 50 cards that Tom took from Jake. We calculate the number of cards Jake has left by subtracting these 50 from 200. 200 - 50 = 150. The condition of the trading cards does not affect the total count of cards Jake possesses, so the number of scratched cards is not a factor in this calculation. Therefore, Jake now has 150 trading cards.\nTherefore, the answer is (150)\n\n\nQ: Sophie had 55 trading cards, and 10 were damaged. Ben bought 25 of Sophie's trading cards. How many trading cards does Sophie have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSophie started with 55 trading cards and 10 of them were damaged. However, damaged cards don't affect the total count of cards she has. So, initially, she still has 55 trading cards. Ben then bought 25 of Sophie's trading cards. To find out how many cards Sophie has left after Ben's purchase, we subtract the number of cards Ben bought from the total number of cards Sophie had. Thus, 55 - 25 = 30. Therefore, Sophie has 30 trading cards left.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\n\nQ: John collected 42 marbles and 18 toy cars from the park. He traded 10 of the marbles with Sarah.

{"idx": 389, "prompt": "Q: A diner prepared 8 burgers during lunchtime and 13 for dinner today. The diner prepared 5 burgers and 4 hot dogs yesterday. How many burgers were prepared in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of burgers prepared today and yesterday. For today, the diner made 8 burgers during lunchtime and 13 burgers during dinner. So, we add these two amounts: 8 + 13 = 21 burgers today. Yesterday, the diner prepared an additional 5 burgers. Combining today's total with yesterday's gives us: 21 + 5 = 26 burgers in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (26)\n\n\nQ: When Lisa had 2 dogs, she needed to serve 1.0 can of dog food each day. Now that Lisa has adopted a third dog, she needs to serve a total of 1.5 cans each day. How much extra food is needed to feed the third dog?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Lisa had 2 dogs and needed to serve 1.0 can of dog food each day. This means that each dog received an average of 1.0 / 2 = 0.5 cans of food per dog per day. After adopting a third dog, the total daily requirement for food increased to 1.5 cans. To find the amount of extra food needed for the third dog, we first determine the amount of food each dog would get now that there are 3 dogs. This is 1.5 cans / 3 dogs = 0.5 cans per dog. We can now compare this amount to the previous average amount per dog. Since each of the first two dogs was getting 0.5 cans before, and the third dog is also getting 0.5 cans, we find that no extra food is needed specifically for the third dog beyond the already sufficient feeding. Therefore, the extra food needed just for the third dog is 0.5 cans - 0.5 cans = 0 cans. However, Lisa now needs a total of 1.5 cans, which is 0.5 cans more than the 1.0 can she originally fed the two dogs. Thus, the overall extra food needed for the three dogs together is 0.5 cans. Hence, the extra food specifically for the third dog alone remains 0 cans beyond the prior requirement.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\n\nQ: Mark owns the Happy Pet Grooming. This morning, his groomers attended to 30 dogs. If they attended to a total of 75 dogs today, how many dogs did they attend to in the afternoon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many dogs were attended to in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of dogs attended to in the morning from the total number of dogs attended to today. Mark's groomers attended to 30 dogs in the morning and 75 dogs in total. Therefore, we calculate: 75 (total dogs) - 30 (morning dogs) = 45 (afternoon dogs).\nTherefore, the answer is (45)\n\n\nQ: A food truck prepared 5 burritos for breakfast and 8 for lunch today.

It served 5 of them the day before. How many salads were served today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of salads served today, we need to add the number of salads served for lunch and dinner, while considering the salads served the day before. The bistro served 10 salads for lunch and 3 salads for dinner. So first, we calculate the total salads served today: 10 (lunch) + 3 (dinner) = 13 salads. However, since 5 of those salads were served the day before, we do not need to subtract anything because they are not duplicates; they don't change the total served today. Therefore, the total number of salads served today is 13.\nTherefore, the answer is (13)\n\n\nQ: A sandwich shop made 7 sandwiches for breakfast and 4 for lunch yesterday.

It states that the shop made 7 sandwiches for breakfast and 4 sandwiches for lunch. Therefore, the total number of sandwiches made for lunch yesterday is directly given as 4. The provided information about sandwiches prepared today (10) does not affect the count of sandwiches made yesterday for lunch. Hence, the answer remains focused on the lunch sandwiches made yesterday.\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\n\nQ: A catering service prepared 8 appetizers for a lunch event and 6 for dinner today.

Next, we add the appetizers prepared for the dinner event, which is 6. This gives us a total of 8 + 6 = 14 appetizers for today. Finally, we add the 2 appetizers that were prepared yesterday. So, the total number of appetizers prepared is 14 + 2 = 16.\nTherefore, the answer is (16)\n\n\nQ: A catering service prepared 4 trays of appetizers for an event and 8 trays for another event today. The service prepared 6 trays and 3 desserts yesterday.

According to the information provided, the catering service prepared 4 trays of appetizers for the first event and 8 trays for another event today. Therefore, for today, the number of trays of appetizers prepared is 4 + 8 = 12. As the question only involves today's preparation of appetizers, the total number of trays of appetizers prepared is 12. The trays prepared yesterday (6 trays and 3 desserts) do not affect the count for today. Thus, the total number of trays of appetizers prepared in total is 12.\nTherefore, the answer is (12)\n\n\n"}

How many lily plants will the botanical garden have when the workers are finished?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the total number of lily plants in the botanical garden after the new plants are added, we start with the current number of lily plants, which is 75. Today, the garden staff will plant an additional 45 lily plants. Tomorrow, they will plant another 50 lily plants. We need to calculate the total number of new plants that will be added over the two days and add this to the current total.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of lily plants to be added.\nTotal new plants = 45 (today) + 50 (tomorrow) = 95.\n\nStep 2: Add the total number of new plants to the initial number of lily plants in the garden.\nTotal lily plants after planting = Current lily plants + Total new plants = 75 + 95 = 170.\n\nThus, the botanical garden will have 170 lily plants when the workers are finished.\nTherefore, the answer is (170)\n\n\nQ: A farm has 40 coconut trees and 10 banana trees. Workers had to cut down 8 coconut trees that were withering. How many coconut trees will be remaining on the farm after the workers are finished?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nStart with the initial number of coconut trees, which is 40. We need to subtract the number of coconut trees that were cut down due to withering. Since 8 coconut trees are cut down, we perform the calculation: 40 - 8 = 32. Therefore, the remaining number of coconut trees on the farm is 32.\nTherefore, the answer is (32)\n\n\n"}
