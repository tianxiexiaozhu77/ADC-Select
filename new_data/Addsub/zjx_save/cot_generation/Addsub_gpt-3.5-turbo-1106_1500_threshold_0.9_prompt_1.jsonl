How many competitions did they win?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many competitions Sophia's cheerleading squad won, we start with the total number of competitions, which is 10. According to the information given, they placed second in 2 of these competitions. This implies that they did not win these 2 competitions. Therefore, to find out how many they won, we subtract the number of competitions where they placed second from the total competitions: 10 total competitions - 2 second placements = 8 competitions.

How many matches did they win?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many matches Michael's soccer team won, we first need to determine how many matches they did not lose. The team played a total of 18 matches and lost 5. The number of matches they either won or drew is given by subtracting the number of losses from the total matches played: 18 - 5 = 13. Since the problem states that they emerged victorious in the majority of the games, they must have won more matches than they lost. Therefore, if they have lost 5 matches, to have won the majority of the matches, they must have won at least 10 matches, which is the case since 13 matches are left to win or draw. Hence, the total number of wins is the remaining matches which they won. After determining the losses and the total matches, we can confirm that they won 13 - 5 = 8 matches alone, so the outcome will not reach 10 wins, thus validating they won 10 matches exactly, making it the maximum. Hence, finally we can confirm that they won 13 matches with 10 being the ideal outcome over the available math.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\n\nQ: Ethan's baseball team played 20 games this year.

They excelled in the majority of their races. They finished in second place for 3 events. How many events did they win?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe track team participated in a total of 9 events. They finished in second place in 3 of those events. To find out how many events they won, we first note that 'excelling in the majority of races' implies that they must have finished first in more events than they finished in second place. Since there were 3 second-place finishes, the team must have won more than 3 events to have a majority. Therefore, we can calculate the number of wins by subtracting the second-place finishes from the total events: 9 events - 3 second-place finishes = 6 potential events left. However, they must have at least 4 wins to surpass the 3 second-place finishes. Thus, they won 6 - 3 = 6 events, as this satisfies the condition of having a majority of wins. So, they won 6 events in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\n\nQ: Lily's volleyball squad competed in 15 tournaments this season. The team was triumphant in the majority of these events.

Next, we will add the number of pine trees that will be planted by the forestry workers, which is 20. To find the total number of pine trees after the planting is complete, we need to add these two numbers together: 80 + 20. This gives us 100. Therefore, the total number of pine trees in the forest after the workers finish planting is 100.\nTherefore, the answer is (100)\n\n\nQ: There are 10 pine trees currently in the forest. Foresters will plant pine trees today. When the foresters are finished there will be 40 pine trees in the forest.

{"idx": 206, "prompt": "Q: Last year, 5000 tourists visited the island, and 800 foreigners relocated there. How many new residents began living on the island last year?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many new residents began living on the island last year, we need to consider the number of foreigners who relocated there. The number of tourists (5000) is not relevant to the number of new residents, as they are temporary visitors and do not count as residents. The only pertinent information is that 800 foreigners relocated to the island, which signifies that these individuals became new residents. Therefore, the number of new residents is simply the number of relocators.\nTherefore, the answer is (800)\n\n\nQ: Last year, 80000 houses were built, and 15000 new residents moved in.

We know that 980 tons of coal fell off and 220 tons are left in the train. Therefore, the original weight of coal can be calculated by summing the weight lost and the weight remaining: 980 tons (fallen) + 220 tons (remaining) = 1200 tons. Thus, the train originally carried 1200 tons of coal.\nTherefore, the answer is (1200)\n\n\nQ: A fishing boat casts its nets but hits a sandbank. By the time the boat is afloat again, 200 fish have escaped. Only 30 fish are still in the net. How many fish were originally caught by the boat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the total number of fish originally caught by the boat be represented as 'x'. When the boat hits the sandbank, 200 fish escape. After this, 30 fish remain in the net. Therefore, the number of fish that escaped plus the number of fish still in the net must equal the original number of fish caught. This gives us the equation: x - 200 + 30 = x. Simplifying this, we have: x - 200 + 30 = x, which simplifies to 30 - 200 = 0. This implies that the original amount of fish caught is 200 + 30 = 230. Thus, the boat originally caught a total of 230 fish.\nTherefore, the answer is (230)\n\n\nQ: A tank ruptured at a hazardous material facility.

{"idx": 245, "prompt": "Q: In Mr. Johnson's history class, 0.75 of the students obtained A grades and 0.1 received B grades. What fraction of the students received either A grades or B grades?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the fraction of students who received either A or B grades, we need to add the fractions of students who received A grades and B grades together. The fraction of students who received A grades is 0.75 and the fraction of students who received B grades is 0.1. First, we convert these decimal fractions into a common format to add them. We can convert 0.75 to a fraction, which is 75/100, or simplify that to 3/4. The decimal 0.1 also converts to a fraction as 1/10. Now, we need to add these two fractions together. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 10 is 20. Thus, we convert each fraction: (3/4) becomes (15/20) and (1/10) becomes (2/20).

What fraction of the students in the choir are in either the soprano section or the alto section?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the fraction of students in either the soprano or alto section, we start by adding the fractions of students in each section. The fraction of students in the soprano section is 0.6 and the fraction of students in the alto section is 0.15. We can calculate the total by performing the addition: 0.6 + 0.15. First, we convert these decimals into fractions if needed. 0.6 can be expressed as 6/10 and 0.15 can be expressed as 15/100. To add these, we can convert them to a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 100 is 100. Thus, we convert 0.6 (6/10) to 60/100. Now we add: 60/100 + 15/100 = 75/100. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 25. This simplification gives us 3/4. Therefore, the fraction of students in either the soprano or alto section is 3/4.\nTherefore, the answer is ((0.75))\n\n\nQ: A teacher is grading two sets of exams. The total number of exams is 150.

After adopting a second hamster, the total food requirement increased to 0.3 cup per day. To find the extra food needed for the second hamster, we subtract the initial food requirement from the new total. Therefore, 0.3 cup (total for 2 hamsters) - 0.1 cup (for 1 hamster) = 0.2 cup. This means the second hamster requires an additional 0.2 cup of food daily.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.2).)\n\n\nQ: When Tom had 3 fish, he needed to serve 0.3 cans of fish food every day. Now that Tom has adopted a fourth fish, he needs to serve a total of 0.6 cans each day. How much extra food is needed to feed the fourth fish?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how much fish food Tom was using for each fish initially. When Tom had 3 fish, he served 0.3 cans of fish food every day. Therefore, the food per fish was 0.3 cans divided by 3 fish, which equals 0.1 cans per fish. Now, after adopting a fourth fish, Tom serves 0.6 cans of food per day. We can again divide the total food (0.6 cans) by the number of fish (4) to find how much food is needed per fish now, which equals 0.6 cans divided by 4 fish, resulting in 0.15 cans per fish. To find the extra food needed for the fourth fish, we can subtract the original amount of food per fish (0.1 cans) from the new amount (0.15 cans): 0.15 - 0.1 = 0.05 cans. Therefore, he needs an extra 0.05 cans of food to feed the fourth fish.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.05).)\n\n\nQ: When Brian had 2 turtles, he needed to serve 0.5 can of turtle food each day. Now that Brian has adopted a third turtle, he needs to serve a total of 1 can each day. How much extra food is needed to feed the third turtle?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Brian had 2 turtles and needed to serve 0.5 can of turtle food each day. This means that for 2 turtles, the daily food requirement was 0.5 can. The amount of food per turtle is calculated as follows: 0.5 can / 2 turtles = 0.25 can per turtle per day. When Brian adopted a third turtle, the total daily food requirement increased to 1 can for 3 turtles. We can calculate the new amount of food per turtle as follows: 1 can / 3 turtles = 0.333... can per turtle. To find out how much extra food is needed for the third turtle, we subtract the original amount per turtle from the new amount per turtle: 0.333... can - 0.25 can = 0.083... can. This means that the third turtle needs approximately 0.083... can extra per day. When considering food in practical terms, rounding to a suitable measurement may vary, but in precise terms, extra food needed for the third turtle is approximately 0.083 can per day.\nTherefore, the answer is ((0.083))\n\n\nQ: When Anna had 1 guinea pig, she needed to serve 0.6 cups of guinea pig food each day. Now that Anna has adopted a second guinea pig, she needs to serve a total of 1.1 cups each day. How much extra food is needed to feed the second guinea pig?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nAnna initially needed 0.6 cups of food for one guinea pig. After adopting a second guinea pig, the total food requirement increased to 1.1 cups per day. To find out how much extra food is needed for the second guinea pig, we subtract the initial food amount (0.6 cups) from the new total (1.1 cups). This gives us 1.1 - 0.6 = 0.5 cups. Therefore, the extra food needed to feed the second guinea pig is 0.5 cups.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.5).)\n\n\nQ: Mark has 3 cats. Each day, 1 cat eats 0.2 scoop of cat food and the other two cats each eat 0.2 scoop. Together, how much cat food do the 3 cats eat each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by the 3 cats, we first note the food consumption per cat. Each cat consumes 0.2 scoops of cat food. Since there are 3 cats, we can calculate the total consumption by adding the food eaten by each cat: 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 = 0.6 scoops. Therefore, together, the 3 cats eat a total of 0.6 scoops of cat food each day.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.6).)\n\n\n"}

If the workers cut down 10 hazardous birch trees, we need to subtract the number of trees cut down from the initial number of trees. This can be calculated as follows: 40 (initial trees) - 10 (trees cut down) = 30 (remaining trees). Therefore, there will be 30 birch trees left in the neighborhood after the workers are finished.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\n\nQ: There are 12 oak trees currently in the plantation. Workers will plant 50 oak trees today and 18 oak trees tomorrow. How many oak trees will the plantation have when the workers are finished?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nStart with the current number of oak trees in the plantation, which is 12. Today, workers will plant 50 more oak trees. Adding these together gives: 12 + 50 = 62. Then, tomorrow, they will plant an additional 18 oak trees. So, adding these trees as well gives: 62 + 18 = 80. Therefore, the total number of oak trees in the plantation after all planting is completed will be 80.\nTherefore, the answer is (80)\n\n\nQ: There are 25 oak trees currently in the backyard. Homeowners will plant oak trees today. When they are finished there will be 60 oak trees in the backyard. How many oak trees did they plant today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many oak trees were planted today, we start with the current number of oak trees, which is 25. The homeowners want to have a total of 60 oak trees after planting new ones. We can set up the equation: current trees + new trees = total trees. This can be represented as: 25 + x = 60, where x is the number of new trees planted. To find x, we can rearrange the equation: x = 60 - 25. Performing the subtraction gives us x = 35. Therefore, the homeowners planted 35 oak trees today.\nTherefore, the answer is (35)\n\n\n"}

Mark removed some purple daisies from his garden. There are now 13 purple daisies in the vase. How many purple daisies did he remove?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 8 purple daisies in the vase. Mark removed some purple daisies from his garden. After the removal, there are 13 purple daisies in the vase. To determine how many purple daisies Mark removed from his garden, we can use the following calculation: We know the number of purple daisies in the vase after the removal is 13. Since Mark actually added purple daisies to the vase, we need to figure out how many daisies were added to reach that number. We can set up the equation: 8 (initial purple daisies) + x (purple daisies added) = 13 (purple daisies in the vase after removal). Solving for x, we find that x = 13 - 8 which equals 5. Therefore, Mark removed 5 purple daisies from his garden to add to the vase.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\n\nQ: There are 18 daisies and 22 tulips currently in the park's flower beds.

The gardeners aim to plant more red flowers to reach a total of 60 red flowers. To find out how many red flowers the gardeners need to plant, we subtract the current number of red flowers from the desired total. This calculation can be represented as: 60 (desired total) - 12 (current flowers) = 48. Therefore, the gardeners will plant 48 red flowers today.\nTherefore, the answer is (48)\n\n\nQ: There are 22 elm trees currently in the botanical garden.

{"idx": 356, "prompt": "Q: David discovered 40 coins and 30 stamps while cleaning his room. He gave Jenny some of his coins. He has 25 coins left. How many coins did he give to Jenny?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nDavid initially had 40 coins. After giving some coins to Jenny, he ended up with 25 coins. To find out how many coins he gave to Jenny, we can use the equation: Initial coins - Coins given = Remaining coins. Plugging in the numbers: 40 - Coins given = 25. To solve for the number of coins given, we can rearrange this equation to find: Coins given = 40 - 25. This simplifies to Coins given = 15. Thus, David gave Jenny 15 coins.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\n\nQ: Hannah caught 11 fish, Ethan caught 8 fish, and Mia caught 6 fish in the lake. After counting, they found that 3 were too small to keep. How many fish did they catch altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find the total number of fish caught by Hannah, Ethan, and Mia. This can be done by adding the number of fish each person caught: 11 (Hannah) + 8 (Ethan) + 6 (Mia) = 25 fish altogether. However, we learned that 3 of these fish were too small to keep. To find how many fish they caught that were keepable, we subtract the 3 small fish from the total caught: 25 - 3 = 22 keepable fish. Since the question asks how many fish they caught altogether, we focus on the initial total without subtracting the small fish. Therefore, the answer is the total fish initially caught, which is 25.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\n\nQ: Sophie found 18 marbles and Jake found 32 marbles at the fair.

This can be done by adding the number of fish each person caught: 11 (Hannah) + 8 (Ethan) + 6 (Mia) = 25 fish altogether. However, we learned that 3 of these fish were too small to keep. To find how many fish they caught that were keepable, we subtract the 3 small fish from the total caught: 25 - 3 = 22 keepable fish. Since the question asks how many fish they caught altogether, we focus on the initial total without subtracting the small fish. Therefore, the answer is the total fish initially caught, which is 25.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\n\nQ: Alex caught 29 fish and Jamie caught 11 fish in the lake.

After counting, they found that 3 were too small to keep. How many fish did they catch altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find the total number of fish caught by Hannah, Ethan, and Mia. This can be done by adding the number of fish each person caught: 11 (Hannah) + 8 (Ethan) + 6 (Mia) = 25 fish altogether. However, we learned that 3 of these fish were too small to keep. To find how many fish they caught that were keepable, we subtract the 3 small fish from the total caught: 25 - 3 = 22 keepable fish. Since the question asks how many fish they caught altogether, we focus on the initial total without subtracting the small fish. Therefore, the answer is the total fish initially caught, which is 25.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\n\nQ: Laura had 10 strawberries and 5 blueberries in her kitchen. She went to the garden and picked strawberries to have more. There are now 50 strawberries. How many did she pick?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLaura initially had 10 strawberries. She picked additional strawberries from the garden and now has a total of 50 strawberries. To find out how many strawberries she picked, we can frame the equation: Starting strawberries + Picked strawberries = Total strawberries. Let 'x' represent the number of strawberries picked. Therefore, 10 + x = 50. Solving for x gives us x = 50 - 10, which simplifies to x = 40. Therefore, Laura picked 40 strawberries.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\n\nQ: In the garden, there were 11 orange marigolds and 5 white marigolds. Lisa sowed some orange marigolds from her stock.
