{"question": "There are 52 berry bushes currently in the orchard. Orchard workers will plant 10 berry bushes today and 20 berry bushes tomorrow. It took 15 workers to finish the work. How many berry bushes will the orchard have when the workers are finished?", "cot": "We start with 52 berry bushes in the orchard. Today, the orchard workers will plant an additional 10 berry bushes, which increases the total to 52 + 10 = 62 berry bushes. Tomorrow, they will plant another 20 berry bushes. So, we then calculate 62 + 20 = 82 berry bushes in total after both days of planting. Therefore, the total number of berry bushes in the orchard after the workers finish planting will be 82.", "answer": "82", "score": 5.273728829005328}
{"question": "There are 50 bushes and 15 trees currently in the backyard. The landscapers will plant bushes today. Once they are done there will be 120 bushes in the backyard. How many bushes did the landscapers plant today?", "cot": "Initially, there are 50 bushes in the backyard. The landscapers will plant additional bushes such that the total number of bushes will be 120. To find out how many bushes will be planted, we subtract the initial number of bushes from the total number of bushes desired. Therefore, we calculate: 120 (total desired bushes) - 50 (initial bushes) = 70. This means the landscapers will plant 70 bushes today.", "answer": "70", "score": 5.198801269340964}
{"question": "There are 20 birch trees in the nature park. Maintenance crew had to cut down 4 birch trees that were damaged. How many birch trees will the nature park have when the crew is finished ?", "cot": "Start with the total number of birch trees in the nature park, which is 20. The maintenance crew has to cut down 4 damaged birch trees. To find out how many birch trees remain after cutting down the 4 trees, we subtract the number of cut trees from the total number of trees: 20 - 4 = 16. Therefore, the nature park will have 16 birch trees remaining once the crew is finished.", "answer": "16", "score": 5.341658162155449}
{"question": "There are 20 cedar trees currently in the campground. Campground staff will plant 1 cedar tree today and 4 cedar trees tomorrow. It took 2 workers to finish the job.

Today, 1 cedar tree will be planted, which adds to the existing number. Tomorrow, an additional 4 cedar trees will be planted. Therefore, we first calculate the total number of trees after both planting days. Starting with 20, we add 1 for today and then add 4 for tomorrow. This can be expressed mathematically as: 20 + 1 + 4 = 25. Thus, after planting the trees, the total number in the campground will be 25.", "answer": "25", "score": 5.594282553606595}

How many rose bushes will the garden have when the workers are finished?", "cot": "To find the total number of rose bushes in the garden after planting the new ones, we start with the initial number of rose bushes and then add the number planted today and tomorrow. Initially, there are 56 rose bushes. Today, 22 more will be planted, and tomorrow, an additional 18 will be planted. We calculate the total added bushes as follows: 22 (today) + 18 (tomorrow) = 40. Next, we add this to the initial amount: 56 + 40 = 96. Therefore, the total number of rose bushes in the garden after the workers are finished planting is 96.", "answer": "Therefore, the answer is (96).", "score": 5.609016755221089}
{"question": "There are 15 birch trees currently in the yard. Yard caretakers will plant 4 birch trees today and 6 birch trees tomorrow. It took 7 workers to accomplish the work. How many birch trees will the yard have when the workers are finished?", "cot": "Currently, there are 15 birch trees in the yard. The caretakers will plant additional trees: 4 birch trees today and 6 birch trees tomorrow. To find out the total number of birch trees after the planting is completed, we need to add the current number of birch trees to the number of trees that will be planted. First, we calculate the total number of new birch trees being planted: 4 (today) + 6 (tomorrow) = 10. Next, we add the new birch trees to the current number of birch trees: 15 (current) + 10 (new) = 25. Thus, after the workers are finished planting, the total number of birch trees in the yard will be 25.", "answer": "25", "score": 5.365295668849298}

When the workers are finished there will be 100 small shrubs in the garden. How many small shrubs did the workers plant today?", "cot": "To find out how many small shrubs the workers planted today, we start with the current number of small shrubs which is 45. Since the goal is to have 100 small shrubs, we need to determine how many more small shrubs are needed to reach this total. We can do this by subtracting the current number of small shrubs from the target number of small shrubs: 100 (target) - 45 (current) = 55. Therefore, the workers planted 55 small shrubs today.", "answer": "Therefore, the answer is (55).", "score": 5.364102318444407}
