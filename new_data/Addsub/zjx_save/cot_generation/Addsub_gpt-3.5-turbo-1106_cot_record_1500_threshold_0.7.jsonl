Since these two groups do not overlap (a project cannot be both outstanding and decent), we can simply add the two fractions together. First, we convert the decimals to fractions: 0.9 is equivalent to 9/10 and 0.05 is equivalent to 5/100. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 100 is 100. Rewriting the fractions: 9/10 becomes 90/100. Now we can add: 90/100 + 5/100 = 95/100.
