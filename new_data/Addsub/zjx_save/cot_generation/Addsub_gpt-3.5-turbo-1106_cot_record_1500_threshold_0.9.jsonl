Initially, there are 56 rose bushes. Today, 22 more will be planted, and tomorrow, an additional 18 will be planted. We calculate the total added bushes as follows: 22 (today) + 18 (tomorrow) = 40. Next, we add this to the initial amount: 56 + 40 = 96. Therefore, the total number of rose bushes in the garden after the workers are finished planting is 96.", "answer": "96", "score": 5.609016755221089}
{"question": "There are 45 small shrubs and 20 large shrubs currently in the garden. Garden workers will plant small shrubs today. When the workers are finished there will be 100 small shrubs in the garden. How many small shrubs did the workers plant today?", "cot": "To find out how many small shrubs the workers planted today, we start with the current number of small shrubs which is 45. Since the goal is to have 100 small shrubs, we need to determine how many more small shrubs are needed to reach this total. We can do this by subtracting the current number of small shrubs from the target number of small shrubs: 100 (target) - 45 (current) = 55. Therefore, the workers planted 55 small shrubs today.", "answer": "55", "score": 5.364102318444407}
