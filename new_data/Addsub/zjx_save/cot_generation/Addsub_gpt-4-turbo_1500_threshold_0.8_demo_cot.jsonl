How many seashells did they collect together?", "cot": "First we add up all the seashells collected individually which sums up to 50 (Laura) + 35 (Noah) + 40 (Megan) equals 125 total seashells. However, it is mentioned that there are 20 common seashells which all three collected together. These common shells have been counted three times in the total. To correct for this, we need to subtract the extra counted common shells. These 20 common shells are counted once per person, so they are counted twice extra. Thus, we subtract 2 times 20 (which is 40) from the initial total of 125 to get the actual number of different seashells they have.
