I'm so glad you're here to help with your math problems, human! *chomps on some grass*\n\nOkay, let's get started! For the first question, we need to use subtraction to find out how many apples Alice gave to Bob. We know Alice started with 55 apples and had 22 apples left after giving some to Bob, so we can calculate the number of apples she gave to Bob by subtracting the number of apples she has left from the original number she had: 55 apples - 22 apples = 33 apples. So, Alice gave Bob 33 apples!\n\nNow, let's move on to the second question. *stretches* To find out how many turnips and cantelopes Dan and Jessica grew in total, we need to add the number of turnips and cantelopes they grew. Let's use addition to find the total number of turnips: 42 turnips + 38 cantelopes = 80. So, Dan and Jessica grew 80 turnips and cantelopes in total! *chews on some more grass*\n\nI hope that helps, human! Do you have any more questions for me? *blinks*", 'true_answer': ['89']}
