To find out how much extra food is required for the new dog, we need to subtract the food requirement of the original dog from the total combined requirement. That is, 2 kg (total for both dogs) - 1.1 kg (for the first dog) = 0.9 kg.\nTherefore, the answer is (0.9).\n\nFinally, let's answer the third question:\n\nQuestion: When Jake had 1 cat, he needed to serve 0.5 can of cat food each day. Now that Jake has adopted a second cat, he needs to serve a total of 0.9 can each day. How much extra food is needed to feed the second cat?\nAnswer: Great question! Let's use our math skills to find the answer. üê±\n\nStep 1: Identify how much cat food one cat eats daily, which is 0.5 cans.\nStep 2: Calculate the total daily consumption for both cats by multiplying the amount one cat eats by the number of cats, which is 2 * 0.5 = 1 can.\nStep 3: Perform the multiplication to find the total daily consumption: 1 can.\nTherefore, the answer is (1 can).\n\nI hope this helps you with your questions! üòä", 'true_answer': ['0.4']}

He recently got 2 more fish, raising his total water use to 2.4 liters daily. How much additional water is needed for the new fish?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Dan needed 1.5 liters of water daily for 3 fish. This determines that each fish required 1.5 / 3 = 0.5 liters of water per day. When Dan added 2 more fish, making it a total of 5 fish, his daily water use increased to 2.4 liters. The amount of water needed for 5 fish at the rate of 0.5 liters per fish is 5 x 0.5 = 2.5 liters. Since Dan only uses 2.4 liters, this signals either a small calculation or rounding discrepancy. To calculate the additional water specifically needed for the new 2 fish, we subtract the original amount of water for 3 fish from the new total water amount: 2.4 - 1.5 = 0.9 liters.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.9).)\n\nQuestion: There are 7.75 gallons of water in Becky 's fish tank .

How many did she collect?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Emily had 75 seashells. After collecting more over the weekend, she has 100 seashells now. To find how many seashells she collected during the weekend, we need to subtract the initial number of seashells from the total number she has now. The calculation is 100 (total seashells after weekend) - 75 (initial seashells) = 25 seashells. So, Emily collected 25 seashells over the weekend.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: Laura collected 50 seashells, Noah collected 35 seashells, and Megan collected 40 seashells by the seaside. After cleaning them, they realized that 20 were common shells. How many seashells did they collect together?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst we add up all the seashells collected individually which sums up to 50 (Laura) + 35 (Noah) + 40 (Megan) equals 125 total seashells. However, it is mentioned that there are 20 common seashells which all three collected together. These common shells have been counted three times in the total. To correct for this, we need to subtract the extra counted common shells. These 20 common shells are counted once per person, so they are counted twice extra. Thus, we subtract 2 times 20 (which is 40) from the initial total of 125 to get the actual number of different seashells they have. Therefore, 125 - 40 equals 85 seashells collected in total by Laura, Noah, and Megan.\nTherefore, the answer is (85)\n\nQuestion: Joan found 75 seashells and 14 starfishes on the beach .
