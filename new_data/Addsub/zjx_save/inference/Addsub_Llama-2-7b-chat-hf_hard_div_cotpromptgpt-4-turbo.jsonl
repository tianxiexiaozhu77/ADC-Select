How many miles did Trisha walk in all ? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many miles Trisha walked in total, we need to add up the distances she walked during each segment of her trip. First, she walked 0.1111111111111111 mile from her hotel to the postcard shop. Then, she walked another 0.1111111111111111 mile from the postcard shop to the T-shirt shop. Finally, she walked 0.6666666666666666 mile from the T-shirt shop back to the hotel.

To get the total, we add these amounts together: 0.25 (from the first table) + 0.25 (from the second table) + 0.375 (from the third table) = 0.875. Therefore, the waitress finds a total of 0.875 bottles of mustard.\nTherefore, the answer is (0.875).\n\nQ: Benny received 79 dollars and 9 movie tickets for his birthday . He went to a sporting goods store and bought a baseball glove , baseball , and bat .

After purchasing the baseball gear (glove, baseball, and bat), he had 32 dollars left. To find out how much Benny spent on the baseball gear, we subtract the amount he had left from the amount he initially received. Calculation: 79 dollars (initial amount) - 32 dollars (amount left) = 47 dollars.

How many miles did Trisha walk in all ? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many miles Trisha walked in total, we need to add up the distances she walked during each segment of her trip. First, she walked 0.1111111111111111 mile from her hotel to the postcard shop. Then, she walked another 0.1111111111111111 mile from the postcard shop to the T-shirt shop. Finally, she walked 0.6666666666666666 mile from the T-shirt shop back to the hotel. Adding these three distances together gives us the total distance walked: 0.1111111111111111 + 0.1111111111111111 + 0.6666666666666666 = 0.8888888888888888 miles.\nTherefore, the answer is (0.8888888888888888).\n\nQ: Before starting her shift , a waitress checks to make sure there is enough mustard for her customers .

Altogether , how many bottles of mustard does the waitress find ? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total amount of mustard bottles, we need to add the quantities from each table. The first table has 0.25 of a bottle, the second table also has 0.25 of a bottle, and the third table has 0.375 of a bottle. To get the total, we add these amounts together: 0.25 (from the first table) + 0.25 (from the second table) + 0.375 (from the third table) = 0.875. Therefore, the waitress finds a total of 0.875 bottles of mustard.\nTherefore, the answer is (0.875).\n\nQ: Benny received 79 dollars and 9 movie tickets for his birthday . He went to a sporting goods store and bought a baseball glove , baseball , and bat . He had 32 dollars over , how much did he spent on the baseball gear ? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nBenny initially received 79 dollars. After purchasing the baseball gear (glove, baseball, and bat), he had 32 dollars left. To find out how much Benny spent on the baseball gear, we subtract the amount he had left from the amount he initially received. Calculation: 79 dollars (initial amount) - 32 dollars (amount left) = 47 dollars. Therefore, Benny spent 47 dollars on the baseball gear.\nTherefore, the answer is (47).\n\nQ: While taking inventory at her pastry shop , Kelly realizes that she had 0.4 box of baking powder yesterday , but the supply is now down to 0.3 box .

Next, we add the cost of the song book: $159.14 + $4.14 = $163.28. The amount Joan found in her pocket ($8.65) is not relevant to the total amount she spent at the store, so we ignore it for this calculation. Therefore, the total amount Joan spent at the music store is $163.28.\nTherefore, the answer is (163.28).\n\nQ: Hoping to be named Salesperson of the Month , Rosa called the names from 10.2 pages of the phone book last week .

After purchasing the baseball gear (glove, baseball, and bat), he had 32 dollars left. To find out how much Benny spent on the baseball gear, we subtract the amount he had left from the amount he initially received. Calculation: 79 dollars (initial amount) - 32 dollars (amount left) = 47 dollars.

How much did Joan spend at the music store ? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much Joan spent at the music store, we need to add up the cost of all the items she bought. She bought a trumpet for $149.16, a music tool for $9.98, and a song book for $4.14. First, we add the cost of the trumpet and the music tool: $149.16 + $9.98 = $159.14. Next, we add the cost of the song book: $159.14 + $4.14 = $163.28. The amount Joan found in her pocket ($8.65) is not relevant to the total amount she spent at the store, so we ignore it for this calculation. Therefore, the total amount Joan spent at the music store is $163.28.\nTherefore, the answer is (163.28).\n\nQ: Hoping to be named Salesperson of the Month , Rosa called the names from 10.2 pages of the phone book last week .

The first table has 0.25 of a bottle, the second table also has 0.25 of a bottle, and the third table has 0.375 of a bottle. To get the total, we add these amounts together: 0.25 (from the first table) + 0.25 (from the second table) + 0.375 (from the third table) = 0.875. Therefore, the waitress finds a total of 0.875 bottles of mustard.\nTherefore, the answer is (0.875).\n\nQ: Benny received 79 dollars and 9 movie tickets for his birthday .

Finally, she walked 0.6666666666666666 mile from the T-shirt shop back to the hotel. Adding these three distances together gives us the total distance walked: 0.1111111111111111 + 0.1111111111111111 + 0.6666666666666666 = 0.8888888888888888 miles.\nTherefore, the answer is (0.8888888888888888).\n\nQ: Before starting her shift , a waitress checks to make sure there is enough mustard for her customers . She finds 0.25 bottle at the first table , 0.25 bottle at the second table , and 0.375 bottle at the third table . Altogether , how many bottles of mustard does the waitress find ? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total amount of mustard bottles, we need to add the quantities from each table. The first table has 0.25 of a bottle, the second table also has 0.25 of a bottle, and the third table has 0.375 of a bottle. To get the total, we add these amounts together: 0.25 (from the first table) + 0.25 (from the second table) + 0.375 (from the third table) = 0.875. Therefore, the waitress finds a total of 0.875 bottles of mustard.\nTherefore, the answer is (0.875).\n\nQ: Benny received 79 dollars and 9 movie tickets for his birthday . He went to a sporting goods store and bought a baseball glove , baseball , and bat . He had 32 dollars over , how much did he spent on the baseball gear ? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nBenny initially received 79 dollars. After purchasing the baseball gear (glove, baseball, and bat), he had 32 dollars left. To find out how much Benny spent on the baseball gear, we subtract the amount he had left from the amount he initially received. Calculation: 79 dollars (initial amount) - 32 dollars (amount left) = 47 dollars. Therefore, Benny spent 47 dollars on the baseball gear.\nTherefore, the answer is (47).\n\nQ: While taking inventory at her pastry shop , Kelly realizes that she had 0.4 box of baking powder yesterday , but the supply is now down to 0.3 box .

Yesterday, Kelly had 0.4 box of baking powder, and today she has 0.3 box. The subtraction for this calculation is 0.4 - 0.3. This gives us 0.1, which represents the difference in the amount of baking powder between yesterday and today.\nTherefore, the answer is (0.1).\n\nQ: Irwin 's family went on a camping trip in the mountains .
