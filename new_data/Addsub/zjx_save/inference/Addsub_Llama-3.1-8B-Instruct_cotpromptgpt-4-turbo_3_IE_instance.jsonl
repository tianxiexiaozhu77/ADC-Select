To find out how many cards Jason had to start with, we need to add the number of cards he gave away to the number of cards he has left. \n\nThe calculation is: \nUnknown initial number of cards + 9 (cards given away) = 4 (cards left)\n\nTo find the initial number of cards, we need to isolate the unknown variable. We can do this by subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation. \n\nUnknown initial number of cards = 4 - 9\nUnknown initial number of cards = -5\n\nHowever, the number of cards cannot be negative. This means that Jason did not have enough cards to give 9 away and still have 4 left.

If Jason had at least 9 cards to give away, he must have had more than 4 cards initially. Let's try to find the minimum number of cards he had initially.\n\nIf Jason had 9 cards to give away, he must have had at least 9 + 4 = 13 cards initially.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (13)", 'true_answer': ['13']}

After Sally cut some, there are now 15 red orchids in the vase. To find out how many red orchids she cut, we need to subtract the number of red orchids she has now from the initial number of red orchids.\n\nHowever, we need to consider that the number of red orchids in the vase increased to 15, which means Sally must have added some red orchids. Since there were 3 white orchids initially, and the total number of orchids didn't change, the increase in the number of red orchids must have come from the white orchids. \n\nLet's denote the number of red orchids Sally cut as x. Then, the number of white orchids she cut is 3 (initial white orchids) - 3 (white orchids remaining) = 0, but that is not possible, so we will denote the number of white orchids she cut as y. The total number of orchids she cut is x + y. Since the total number of orchids in the vase is 15, the number of red orchids she added is 15 - 9 = 6. Since the number of white orchids she cut is y, the number of white orchids she added is 3 - y. The total number of orchids she added is 6 + (3 - y) = x + y. Since the total number of orchids she cut is x + y, we can set up the equation x + y = x + y. This equation is true for any value of x and y, so we need to use another piece of information.

How much money did Ryan make at the flea market?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Ryan had 65 dollars. After the flea market, he had 100 dollars. To find out how much he made at the flea market, we need to subtract the initial amount from the final amount.

How many did she collect?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Emily had 75 seashells. After collecting more over the weekend, she has 100 seashells now. To find how many seashells she collected during the weekend, we need to subtract the initial number of seashells from the total number she has now.

After cleaning them, they realized that 20 were common shells. How many seashells did they collect together?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst we add up all the seashells collected individually which sums up to 50 (Laura) + 35 (Noah) + 40 (Megan) equals 125 total seashells. However, it is mentioned that there are 20 common seashells which all three collected together. These common shells have been counted three times in the total. To correct for this, we need to subtract the extra counted common shells. These 20 common shells are counted once per person, so they are counted twice extra. Thus, we subtract 2 times 20 (which is 40) from the initial total of 125 to get the actual number of different seashells they have. Therefore, 125 - 40 equals 85 seashells collected in total by Laura, Noah, and Megan.\nTherefore, the answer is (85)\n\nQuestion: Joan found 75 seashells and 14 starfishes on the beach .
