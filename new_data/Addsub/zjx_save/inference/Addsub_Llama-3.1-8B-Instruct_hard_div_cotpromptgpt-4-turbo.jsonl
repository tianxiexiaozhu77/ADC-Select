How many baseball cards does Dan have now ? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': 'To find out how many baseball cards Dan has now, we need to subtract the number of cards he gave to Sam from the total number of cards he initially had. Dan initially had 97 baseball cards, and he gave 8 cards to Sam. However, the question states that Sam bought 15 cards from Dan, but it does not mean Dan gave 15 cards to Sam. It means Dan sold 15 cards to Sam. So, we need to subtract the total number of cards Dan gave away (8) from the initial number of cards he had (97). Calculation: 97 - 8 = 89. This is the number of cards Dan had left after giving away 8 cards. Then, we need to subtract the 15 cards Dan sold to Sam from the 89 cards he had left. Calculation: 89 - 15 = 74. Therefore, Dan has 74 baseball cards now.', 'true_answer': ['82']}

The first table has 0.25 of a bottle, the second table also has 0.25 of a bottle, and the third table has 0.375 of a bottle. To get the total, we add these amounts together: 0.25 (from the first table) + 0.25 (from the second table) + 0.375 (from the third table) = 0.875. Therefore, the waitress finds a total of 0.875 bottles of mustard.\nTherefore, the answer is (0.875).\n\nQ: Benny received 79 dollars and 9 movie tickets for his birthday . He went to a sporting goods store and bought a baseball glove , baseball , and bat . He had 32 dollars over , how much did he spent on the baseball gear ? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nBenny initially received 79 dollars.

To find out how much Benny spent on the baseball gear, we subtract the amount he had left from the amount he initially received. Calculation: 79 dollars (initial amount) - 32 dollars (amount left) = 47 dollars. Therefore, Benny spent 47 dollars on the baseball gear.\nTherefore, the answer is (47).\n\nQ: While taking inventory at her pastry shop , Kelly realizes that she had 0.4 box of baking powder yesterday , but the supply is now down to 0.3 box .

Sara bought 18 of Melanie 's baseball cards . How many baseball cards does Melanie have now ? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "To find out how many baseball cards Melanie has now, we need to subtract the number of cards she gave to Sara from the total number of cards she initially had. Melanie initially had 30 baseball cards, and she gave 9 to Sara. However, the question states that Sara bought 18 of Melanie's baseball cards, which means Melanie still has the 9 torn cards and the 18 cards Sara bought. To find the total number of cards Melanie has now, we need to add the 9 torn cards to the 18 cards Sara bought: 9 + 18 = 27. Then, we subtract the 9 cards that were torn: 27 - 9 = 18. However, this is not the correct answer because we are subtracting the 9 cards that were torn, not the 9 cards Sara bought. The correct calculation is: 30 (initial cards) - 9 (torn cards) = 21. Then, we add the 18 cards Sara bought: 21 + 18 = 39. Therefore, Melanie has 39 baseball cards now.", 'true_answer': ['12']}
