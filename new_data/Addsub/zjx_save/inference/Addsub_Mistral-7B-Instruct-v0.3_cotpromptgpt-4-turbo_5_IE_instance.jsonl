How many oak trees did the gardeners plant today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many oak trees the gardeners planted today, we need the difference between the total number of oak trees after planting and the initial number of oak trees. Initially, there are 30 oak trees and after planting, there are 75 oak trees.

How many books did she have to start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, to find out how many books Lucy had before giving them away, we need to account for the books she gave to Mira and Nate. She gave 2 books to Mira and 4 books to Nate, which totals to 2 + 4 = 6 books given away. After giving these books away, Lucy has 10 books left. To find the total number of books she originally had, we add the books she gave away to the books she still has: 10 (books she has now) + 6 (books given away) = 16 books.

Therefore, the average daily requirement per snake is 0.3 kg / 3 snakes = 0.1 kg per snake. After purchasing an additional 2 snakes, there are now a total of 5 snakes. The new total daily meat requirement is 0.5 kg. Consequently, the increased requirement for the additional 2 snakes is 0.5 kg (new total) - 0.3 kg (old total) = 0.2 kg. Since the 2 new snakes require 0.2 kg of meat daily, the daily requirement per new snake remains consistent with the initial snakes at 0.1 kg per snake (0.2 kg for 2 snakes / 2 = 0.1 kg). Thus, each new snake also requires 0.1 kg of meat daily.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.2).)\n\nQ: When Rachel had 2 rabbits, she used 0.8 kg of feed every day.

{'question': 'Mike picked 7 apples , Nancy picked 3 apples , and Keith picked 6 apples and 4 pears , at the farm . How many apples were picked in total ? ', 'idx': 346, 'prompt': "Q: Sarah picked 90 apples and 30 oranges from the orchard. She gave some apples to her neighbor. She has 65 apples left. How many apples did she give away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Sarah picked 90 apples. After giving some away to her neighbor, she has 65 apples left. To find out how many apples she gave away, we subtract the number of apples she has left from the number she initially picked. That is 90 apples originally - 65 apples left = 25 apples given away.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: Mike's tree bore apples. He gave 8 to Ben and 5 to Cara. He now has 13 apples. How many apples did he have to start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, let's denote the total number of apples Mike had as 'x'. According to the information given, Mike gave away 8 apples to Ben and 5 apples to Cara. So, the number of apples he gave away in total is 8 + 5 = 13. After giving away these apples, he was left with 13 apples. Therefore, the equation expressing the initial amount of apples before giving any away would be x - 13 (apples given to Ben and Cara) = 13 (apples left with Mike). By solving for x, we get x = 13 (remaining apples) + 13 (apples given away) = 26. This shows that initially, Mike had 26 apples.\nTherefore, the answer is (26)\n\nQ: Tom had 24 apples in his basket. He went to the grove and gathered more apples. Now, there are 78 apples. How many did he gather?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Tom had 24 apples in his basket. After gathering more apples in the grove, the total number of apples increased to 78. The number of apples he gathered can be found by subtracting the initial number of apples from the total number of apples he ended up with. To find this:\nTotal apples after gathering - Initial apples = Apples gathered\n 78 - 24 = 54. Thus, Tom gathered 54 more apples.\nTherefore, the answer is (54)\n\nQ: Mark had 15 apples and 20 oranges at his fruit stand. He visited the market and bought more apples. There are now 40 apples. How many did he buy?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMark initially had 15 apples. He then visited the market and his total count of apples afterward was 40. To find out how many apples he bought, we need to subtract the number of apples he initially had from the total number of apples he had after visiting the market. The calculation is 40 apples (after) - 15 apples (initial) = 25 apples (bought).\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: Sarah picked 3 apples and Tom picked 7 apples from the orchard. After inspecting, they noticed that 5 were rotten. How many apples did they pick together?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of apples picked by both Sarah and Tom. Sarah picked 3 apples and Tom picked 7 apples. To find the total number of apples they picked together, we add the number of apples Sarah picked to the number of apples Tom picked, which is 3 + 7 = 10 apples. The fact that 5 of these apples were rotten does not affect the total number picked, only their condition. Therefore, the total number of apples they picked remains the same.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQuestion: Mike picked 7 apples , Nancy picked 3 apples , and Keith picked 6 apples and 4 pears , at the farm .

He now has 12 tomatoes. How many tomatoes did he have to start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMike initially had a certain number of tomatoes. According to the problem, his plant produced 20 tomatoes and he picked 5 tomatoes for dinner. Thus, he then had 15 tomatoes remaining from the initial 20. However, the problem states he now has 12 tomatoes left. This means that after picking the additional 5 tomatoes for dinner, 3 more tomatoes were either picked or lost. To find the original number of tomatoes, consider that he ended with 12 tomatoes but picked 5 tomatoes for dinner, thus he must have had 17 tomatoes after the plant produced the 20 tomatoes and before he picked for dinner. Adding the 5 he picked results in 17+5 = 22 tomatoes, indicating he originally had 2 more tomatoes before the plant produced 20 more (22 - 20).\nTherefore, the answer is (22)\n\nQ: Ben harvested 8 carrots, Lucy harvested 4 carrots, and Omar harvested 6 carrots.

She went to 11 games and missed 12, so we subtract the number of games she missed from the number of games she went to: 11 - 12 = -1. However, since the number of games cannot be negative, we know that Alyssa actually missed more games than she attended this year.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of games she went to in the previous year (13) and the number of games she plans to go to next year (15). To find the total number of games Alyssa will go to in all, we add the number of games she went to in the previous year and the number of games she plans to go to next year: 13 (last year) + 15 (next year) = 28 games.\n\nSince Alyssa missed more games than she attended this year, we need to subtract the number of games she missed this year from the total number of games she went to in the previous and next years: 28 (total games) - (0 (this year) - 12 (this year missed)) = 40 games.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (40)", 'true_answer': ['39']}

However, it is mentioned that there are 20 common seashells which all three collected together. These common shells have been counted three times in the total. To correct for this, we need to subtract the extra counted common shells. These 20 common shells are counted once per person, so they are counted twice extra. Thus, we subtract 2 times 20 (which is 40) from the initial total of 125 to get the actual number of different seashells they have. Therefore, 125 - 40 equals 85 seashells collected in total by Laura, Noah, and Megan.\nTherefore, the answer is (85)\n\nQuestion: Mary found 45 seashells , Melanie found 23 seashells , and Jason found 32 seashells on the beach .

{'question': 'Keith picked 3 pears and Jason picked 2 pears from the pear tree . Joan picked 5 apples from the apple tree . How many pears were picked in total ? ', 'idx': 383, 'prompt': "Q: John picked 30 apples, Sarah picked 15 apples, and Tom picked 25 apples from the orchard. After sorting, they found 10 apples were rotten. How many apples did they pick in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we add together the number of apples each person picked from the orchard: John picked 30 apples, Sarah picked 15 apples, and Tom picked 25 apples. To find the total number of apples, we calculate 30 (John's apples) + 15 (Sarah's apples) + 25 (Tom's apples) = 70 apples. The fact that 10 of these apples were found to be rotten does not affect the total number of apples picked from the orchard, which remains at 70.\nTherefore, the answer is (70)\n\nQ: Tom picked 4 apples, Lily picked 9 apples, and Max picked 5 apples from the orchard. Later, they found out that 2 apples were rotten. How many apples did they pick together?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of apples picked by adding together the apples picked by each person: Tom picked 4 apples, Lily picked 9 apples, and Max picked 5 apples. Therefore, 4 + 9 + 5 = 18 apples were picked in total. The information about 2 apples being rotten is additional and does not affect the total number of apples picked initially.

After inspecting, they noticed that 5 were rotten. How many apples did they pick together?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of apples picked by both Sarah and Tom. Sarah picked 3 apples and Tom picked 7 apples. To find the total number of apples they picked together, we add the number of apples Sarah picked to the number of apples Tom picked, which is 3 + 7 = 10 apples. The fact that 5 of these apples were rotten does not affect the total number picked, only their condition. Therefore, the total number of apples they picked remains the same.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Alice picked 3 apples, Bob picked 5 apples, and Carol picked 2 apples. They worked for 3 days in the orchard. How many apples did they pick in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of apples picked by Alice, Bob, and Carol over 3 days, first find the total number of apples picked by each of them in one day. Alice picked 3 apples, Bob picked 5 apples, and Carol picked 2 apples. Sum these amounts to find the total apples picked in one day: 3 (Alice) + 5 (Bob) + 2 (Carol) = 10 apples. Since they worked for 3 days, multiply the total apples picked in one day by the number of days worked: 10 apples/day * 3 days = 30 apples. Therefore, together they picked a total of 30 apples over the 3 days.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\nQ: Kevin had 5 pears on his kitchen table.
