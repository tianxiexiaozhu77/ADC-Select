How many miles did Trisha walk in all ? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many miles Trisha walked in total, we need to add up the distances she walked during each segment of her trip. First, she walked 0.1111111111111111 mile from her hotel to the postcard shop. Then, she walked another 0.1111111111111111 mile from the postcard shop to the T-shirt shop. Finally, she walked 0.6666666666666666 mile from the T-shirt shop back to the hotel.

The first table has 0.25 of a bottle, the second table also has 0.25 of a bottle, and the third table has 0.375 of a bottle. To get the total, we add these amounts together: 0.25 (from the first table) + 0.25 (from the second table) + 0.375 (from the third table) = 0.875. Therefore, the waitress finds a total of 0.875 bottles of mustard.\nTherefore, the answer is (0.875).\n\nQ: Benny received 79 dollars and 9 movie tickets for his birthday . He went to a sporting goods store and bought a baseball glove , baseball , and bat .

After purchasing the baseball gear (glove, baseball, and bat), he had 32 dollars left. To find out how much Benny spent on the baseball gear, we subtract the amount he had left from the amount he initially received. Calculation: 79 dollars (initial amount) - 32 dollars (amount left) = 47 dollars. Therefore, Benny spent 47 dollars on the baseball gear.\nTherefore, the answer is (47).\n\nQ: While taking inventory at her pastry shop , Kelly realizes that she had 0.4 box of baking powder yesterday , but the supply is now down to 0.3 box .

How much did Joan spend at the music store ? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much Joan spent at the music store, we need to add up the cost of all the items she bought. She bought a trumpet for $149.16, a music tool for $9.98, and a song book for $4.14. First, we add the cost of the trumpet and the music tool: $149.16 + $9.98 = $159.14. Next, we add the cost of the song book: $159.14 + $4.14 = $163.28. The amount Joan found in her pocket ($8.65) is not relevant to the total amount she spent at the store, so we ignore it for this calculation.

However, if we assume that the workers finished planting all the bushes in one day, we can still find the total number of bushes in the park when the workers are finished. In this case, the answer would be 109 bushes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (109).", 'true_answer': ['109']}
