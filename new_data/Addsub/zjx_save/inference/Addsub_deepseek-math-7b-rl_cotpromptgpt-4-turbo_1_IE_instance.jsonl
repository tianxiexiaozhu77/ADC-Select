How much additional water is needed for the new fish?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Dan needed 1.5 liters of water daily for 3 fish. This determines that each fish required 1.5 / 3 = 0.5 liters of water per day. When Dan added 2 more fish, making it a total of 5 fish, his daily water use increased to 2.4 liters. The amount of water needed for 5 fish at the rate of 0.5 liters per fish is 5 x 0.5 = 2.5 liters. Since Dan only uses 2.4 liters, this signals either a small calculation or rounding discrepancy. To calculate the additional water specifically needed for the new 2 fish, we subtract the original amount of water for 3 fish from the new total water amount: 2.4 - 1.5 = 0.9 liters.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.9).)\n\nQuestion: There are 7.75 gallons of water in Becky 's fish tank .

We know initially she had x kittens, and out of those, 5 were black. She sold 3 kittens (regardless of their color). After this, she had 7 kittens remaining. We can set up the equation based on these details: Initial kittens - Sold kittens = Remaining kittens, which translates into the equation x - 3 = 7. Solving for x gives x = 7 + 3 = 10. Therefore, Jill had 10 kittens initially.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQuestion: Dan 's cat had kittens and 5 had spots . He gave 7 to Tim and 4 to Jason . He now has 5 kittens .
