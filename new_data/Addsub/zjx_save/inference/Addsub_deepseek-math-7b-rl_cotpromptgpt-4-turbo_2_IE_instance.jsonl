How much more flour did Mike have last week?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much more flour Mike had last week compared to this week, we need to subtract the current week's flour weight from last week's flour weight. Last week, Mike had 3.3 kg of flour and this week he has 2.8 kg. Thus, the calculation is: 3.3 kg (last week) - 2.8 kg (this week) = 0.5 kg. Therefore, Mike had 0.5 kg more flour last week than this week.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.5).)\n\nQ: Mark noted the temperature drop each day during a cold front.

What was the total temperature drop over these days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total temperature drop over the three days, we add the temperature drops for each day. On Sunday and Monday, the drop was 0.7777777777777777 degrees each day. Adding these together gives 0.7777777777777777 + 0.7777777777777777 = 1.5555555555555554 degrees for two days. On Tuesday, the drop was 0.5555555555555555 degrees. Adding this to the previous total gives 1.5555555555555554 + 0.5555555555555555 = 2.1111111111111107 degrees.

This determines that each fish required 1.5 / 3 = 0.5 liters of water per day. When Dan added 2 more fish, making it a total of 5 fish, his daily water use increased to 2.4 liters. The amount of water needed for 5 fish at the rate of 0.5 liters per fish is 5 x 0.5 = 2.5 liters. Since Dan only uses 2.4 liters, this signals either a small calculation or rounding discrepancy. To calculate the additional water specifically needed for the new 2 fish, we subtract the original amount of water for 3 fish from the new total water amount: 2.4 - 1.5 = 0.9 liters.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.9).)\n\nQuestion: There are 7.75 gallons of water in Becky 's fish tank .

If her workers used a total of 500 pots today, how many pots did they use in the afternoon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that in the morning 300 pots were used. By the end of the day, the total number of pots used was 500. To find the number of pots used in the afternoon, we subtract the number of pots used in the morning from the total pots used by the end of the day.

How many seashells did they collect together?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst we add up all the seashells collected individually which sums up to 50 (Laura) + 35 (Noah) + 40 (Megan) equals 125 total seashells. However, it is mentioned that there are 20 common seashells which all three collected together. These common shells have been counted three times in the total. To correct for this, we need to subtract the extra counted common shells. These 20 common shells are counted once per person, so they are counted twice extra. Thus, we subtract 2 times 20 (which is 40) from the initial total of 125 to get the actual number of different seashells they have. Therefore, 125 - 40 equals 85 seashells collected in total by Laura, Noah, and Megan.\nTherefore, the answer is (85)\n\nQuestion: Joan found 75 seashells and 14 starfishes on the beach .

After Allen moved more sacks into the cellar, there are now 30 sacks. To find out how many sacks Allen moved, subtract the original number of sacks in the cellar from the new total number of sacks in the cellar: 30 sacks (new total) - 12 sacks (original amount) = 18 sacks.
