He gave 8 to Ben and 5 to Cara. He now has 13 apples. How many apples did he have to start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, let's denote the total number of apples Mike had as 'x'. According to the information given, Mike gave away 8 apples to Ben and 5 apples to Cara. So, the number of apples he gave away in total is 8 + 5 = 13. After giving away these apples, he was left with 13 apples. Therefore, the equation expressing the initial amount of apples before giving any away would be x - 13 (apples given to Ben and Cara) = 13 (apples left with Mike). By solving for x, we get x = 13 (remaining apples) + 13 (apples given away) = 26. This shows that initially, Mike had 26 apples.\nTherefore, the answer is (26)\n\nQ: Sarah collected 32 apples, Kevin collected 15 apples, and Martha collected 20 apples from the apple orchard. How many apples were collected in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find the total number of apples collected by Sarah, Kevin, and Martha. We do this by adding up the number of apples each individual collected. Sarah collected 32 apples, Kevin collected 15 apples, and Martha collected 20 apples. To find the total, we add these numbers together: 32 apples (Sarah) + 15 apples (Kevin) + 20 apples (Martha). Adding these gives us: 32 + 15 + 20 = 67 apples. Therefore, the total number of apples collected by Sarah, Kevin, and Martha is 67.\nTherefore, the answer is (67)\n\nQ: An apple orchard picked 80 apples in the morning and 95 in the afternoon today.

That gives us 45 apples in total. The question asks for the total number of apples picked, not considering whether some were rotten. Hence, despite the fact that 10 apples were discovered to be rotten, the total number of apples initially picked by Alice and Bob, in its entirety, is still 45.\nTherefore, the answer is (45)\n\nQ: John picked 15 apples and Emily picked 32 apples from the orchard.

He gave 8 to Ben and 5 to Cara. He now has 13 apples. How many apples did he have to start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, let's denote the total number of apples Mike had as 'x'. According to the information given, Mike gave away 8 apples to Ben and 5 apples to Cara. So, the number of apples he gave away in total is 8 + 5 = 13. After giving away these apples, he was left with 13 apples. Therefore, the equation expressing the initial amount of apples before giving any away would be x - 13 (apples given to Ben and Cara) = 13 (apples left with Mike). By solving for x, we get x = 13 (remaining apples) + 13 (apples given away) = 26. This shows that initially, Mike had 26 apples.\nTherefore, the answer is (26)\n\nQ: Lily harvested 30 oranges and Jim harvested 45 oranges from their farm. They found that 20 oranges were too ripe.

How many apples did he have to start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, let's denote the total number of apples Mike had as 'x'. According to the information given, Mike gave away 8 apples to Ben and 5 apples to Cara. So, the number of apples he gave away in total is 8 + 5 = 13. After giving away these apples, he was left with 13 apples. Therefore, the equation expressing the initial amount of apples before giving any away would be x - 13 (apples given to Ben and Cara) = 13 (apples left with Mike). By solving for x, we get x = 13 (remaining apples) + 13 (apples given away) = 26. This shows that initially, Mike had 26 apples.\nTherefore, the answer is (26)\n\nQ: Linda picked 45 apples from the orchard. She gave Sarah 29 of them.

The calculations are as follows: 45 (original number of apples) - 29 (apples given to Sarah) = 16 (apples left with Linda).\nTherefore, the answer is (16)\n\nQ: Alice picked 18 apples and Bob picked 27 apples from the orchard. After inspecting, they noticed 10 apples were rotten. How many apples did they pick together?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of apples picked by both Alice and Bob by adding the apples Alice picked to those picked by Bob, which is 18 + 27. That gives us 45 apples in total. The question asks for the total number of apples picked, not considering whether some were rotten. Hence, despite the fact that 10 apples were discovered to be rotten, the total number of apples initially picked by Alice and Bob, in its entirety, is still 45.\nTherefore, the answer is (45)\n\nQ: Kevin had 5 pears on his kitchen table.

To find out how much extra pellets the additional guinea pig requires, subtract the initial consumption from the new total consumption:\n 280 g (total daily consumption with two guinea pigs) - 150 g (consumption with one guinea pig) = 130 g.\n Thus, the second guinea pig requires an additional 130 g of pellets each day.\nTherefore, the answer is (130)\n\nQ: Initially, Tom had 3 snakes requiring a total of 0.3 kg of meat daily. After buying 2 more snakes, the requirement increased to 0.5 kg daily. How much extra meat is needed for the new snakes?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Tom had 3 snakes with a total meat requirement of 0.3 kg daily. Therefore, the average daily requirement per snake is 0.3 kg / 3 snakes = 0.1 kg per snake. After purchasing an additional 2 snakes, there are now a total of 5 snakes. The new total daily meat requirement is 0.5 kg. Consequently, the increased requirement for the additional 2 snakes is 0.5 kg (new total) - 0.3 kg (old total) = 0.2 kg. Since the 2 new snakes require 0.2 kg of meat daily, the daily requirement per new snake remains consistent with the initial snakes at 0.1 kg per snake (0.2 kg for 2 snakes / 2 = 0.1 kg). Thus, each new snake also requires 0.1 kg of meat daily.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.2).)\n\nQ: When Rachel had 2 rabbits, she used 0.8 kg of feed every day.

After Helen adopted another horse, the total number of horses became 4. Assuming each horse still needs 3 bales per week, the total hay requirement for 4 horses would be 12 bales per week (4 horses * 3 bales per horse = 12 bales).

", 'idx': 345, 'prompt': "Q: Jill's cat had kittens and 5 were black. She sold 3 to her neighbors. She now has 7 kittens. How many kittens did she have to start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo solve this problem, we need to figure out how many kittens Jill initially had. Let's denote this number as x. We know initially she had x kittens, and out of those, 5 were black. She sold 3 kittens (regardless of their color). After this, she had 7 kittens remaining. We can set up the equation based on these details: Initial kittens - Sold kittens = Remaining kittens, which translates into the equation x - 3 = 7. Solving for x gives x = 7 + 3 = 10.

How many tomatoes did he have to start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMike initially had a certain number of tomatoes. According to the problem, his plant produced 20 tomatoes and he picked 5 tomatoes for dinner. Thus, he then had 15 tomatoes remaining from the initial 20. However, the problem states he now has 12 tomatoes left. This means that after picking the additional 5 tomatoes for dinner, 3 more tomatoes were either picked or lost. To find the original number of tomatoes, consider that he ended with 12 tomatoes but picked 5 tomatoes for dinner, thus he must have had 17 tomatoes after the plant produced the 20 tomatoes and before he picked for dinner.

Next, we account for the rocks that were discovered to be ordinary stones. We subtract the number of ordinary stones from the total number of rocks: 25 - 4 = 21. This tells us the total number of colorful rocks they discovered.\nTherefore, the answer is (21)\n\nQ: Laura collected 50 seashells, Noah collected 35 seashells, and Megan collected 40 seashells by the seaside. After cleaning them, they realized that 20 were common shells. How many seashells did they collect together?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst we add up all the seashells collected individually which sums up to 50 (Laura) + 35 (Noah) + 40 (Megan) equals 125 total seashells. However, it is mentioned that there are 20 common seashells which all three collected together. These common shells have been counted three times in the total. To correct for this, we need to subtract the extra counted common shells. These 20 common shells are counted once per person, so they are counted twice extra. Thus, we subtract 2 times 20 (which is 40) from the initial total of 125 to get the actual number of different seashells they have. Therefore, 125 - 40 equals 85 seashells collected in total by Laura, Noah, and Megan.\nTherefore, the answer is (85)\n\nQuestion: Mary found 45 seashells , Melanie found 23 seashells , and Jason found 32 seashells on the beach .

To find the total number of apples, we calculate 30 (John's apples) + 15 (Sarah's apples) + 25 (Tom's apples) = 70 apples. The fact that 10 of these apples were found to be rotten does not affect the total number of apples picked from the orchard, which remains at 70.\nTherefore, the answer is (70)\n\nQ: Alice picked 3 apples, Bob picked 5 apples, and Carol picked 2 apples. They worked for 3 days in the orchard. How many apples did they pick in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of apples picked by Alice, Bob, and Carol over 3 days, first find the total number of apples picked by each of them in one day. Alice picked 3 apples, Bob picked 5 apples, and Carol picked 2 apples. Sum these amounts to find the total apples picked in one day: 3 (Alice) + 5 (Bob) + 2 (Carol) = 10 apples. Since they worked for 3 days, multiply the total apples picked in one day by the number of days worked: 10 apples/day * 3 days = 30 apples. Therefore, together they picked a total of 30 apples over the 3 days.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\nQ: Sarah picked 90 apples and 30 oranges from the orchard.

How many seashells did they collect together?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst we add up all the seashells collected individually which sums up to 50 (Laura) + 35 (Noah) + 40 (Megan) equals 125 total seashells. However, it is mentioned that there are 20 common seashells which all three collected together. These common shells have been counted three times in the total. To correct for this, we need to subtract the extra counted common shells. These 20 common shells are counted once per person, so they are counted twice extra. Thus, we subtract 2 times 20 (which is 40) from the initial total of 125 to get the actual number of different seashells they have. Therefore, 125 - 40 equals 85 seashells collected in total by Laura, Noah, and Megan.\nTherefore, the answer is (85)\n\nQuestion: Joan found 75 seashells and 14 starfishes on the beach .

After she adopted another horse, the total hay needed rose to 12 bales per week. What is the additional hay requirement per week?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Helen had 3 horses and they collectively needed 9 bales of hay per week, which means each horse required 3 bales (9 bales / 3 horses = 3 bales per horse per week). After Helen adopted another horse, the total number of horses became 4. Assuming each horse still needs 3 bales per week, the total hay requirement for 4 horses would be 12 bales per week (4 horses * 3 bales per horse = 12 bales). The additional hay requirement per week after adopting another horse is found by subtracting the original hay requirement from the new hay requirement, i.e., 12 bales (new requirement) - 9 bales (original requirement) = 3 bales.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: There were 18 bags of rice in the storeroom and 22 bags in the kitchen.

She has 98 apples now. How many apples did she give to her neighbor?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSarah initially picked 120 apples. After giving some to her neighbor, she has 98 apples left. To find out how many apples she gave away, we need to subtract the number of apples she has now from the number of apples she initially picked. So, 120 apples (initially picked) - 98 apples (now) = 22 apples (given to the neighbor).\nTherefore, the answer is (22)\n\nQ: Mike harvested 15 apples, Lucy harvested 30 apples, and Dan harvested 8 apples. They worked for 20 days in the orchard. How many apples did they harvest in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate how many apples each individual person harvested by adding up the apples they collected: Mike harvested 15 apples, Lucy harvested 30 apples, and Dan harvested 8 apples. To find the total number of apples harvested by all three, we add these amounts together: 15 + 30 + 8. The calculation is (15+30+8) which equals 53. This total of 53 apples is the sum of all the apples they harvested over the 20 days they worked in the orchard.\nTherefore, the answer is (53)\n\nQ: John picked 45 apples and Jane picked 30 apples from the orchard. After inspecting them, they realized that 20 were rotten. How many apples did they pick in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, find the total number of apples John and Jane picked by adding together the apples each picked individually. John picked 45 apples and Jane picked 30 apples. The sum of these numbers is 45 + 30 = 75 apples. The question claims that 20 of these apples were rotten, but it only asks for the total number of apples picked, which includes both good and rotten apples. Therefore, the total number of apples picked is the sum calculated, which is 75.\nTherefore, the answer is (75)\n\nQ: Sarah picked 3 apples and Tom picked 7 apples from the orchard. After inspecting, they noticed that 5 were rotten. How many apples did they pick together?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of apples picked by both Sarah and Tom. Sarah picked 3 apples and Tom picked 7 apples. To find the total number of apples they picked together, we add the number of apples Sarah picked to the number of apples Tom picked, which is 3 + 7 = 10 apples. The fact that 5 of these apples were rotten does not affect the total number picked, only their condition. Therefore, the total number of apples they picked remains the same.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Alice picked 3 apples, Bob picked 5 apples, and Carol picked 2 apples. They worked for 3 days in the orchard. How many apples did they pick in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of apples picked by Alice, Bob, and Carol over 3 days, first find the total number of apples picked by each of them in one day. Alice picked 3 apples, Bob picked 5 apples, and Carol picked 2 apples. Sum these amounts to find the total apples picked in one day: 3 (Alice) + 5 (Bob) + 2 (Carol) = 10 apples. Since they worked for 3 days, multiply the total apples picked in one day by the number of days worked: 10 apples/day * 3 days = 30 apples. Therefore, together they picked a total of 30 apples over the 3 days.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\nQ: Kevin had 5 pears on his kitchen table.

At the moment, they have a combined total of 7250 grams of these vegetables. If they have 4980 grams of potatoes, how many grams of carrots do they have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the amount of carrots, subtract the amount of potatoes from the total weight of both vegetables. Total weight of vegetables (potatoes and carrots) = 7250 grams. Weight of potatoes = 4980 grams. Therefore, weight of carrots = Total weight - Weight of potatoes = 7250 grams - 4980 grams.\nTherefore, the answer is (2270)\n\nQ: Mike's plant produced 20 tomatoes and 10 were red. He picked 5 for dinner. He now has 12 tomatoes. How many tomatoes did he have to start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMike initially had a certain number of tomatoes. According to the problem, his plant produced 20 tomatoes and he picked 5 tomatoes for dinner. Thus, he then had 15 tomatoes remaining from the initial 20. However, the problem states he now has 12 tomatoes left. This means that after picking the additional 5 tomatoes for dinner, 3 more tomatoes were either picked or lost. To find the original number of tomatoes, consider that he ended with 12 tomatoes but picked 5 tomatoes for dinner, thus he must have had 17 tomatoes after the plant produced the 20 tomatoes and before he picked for dinner. Adding the 5 he picked results in 17+5 = 22 tomatoes, indicating he originally had 2 more tomatoes before the plant produced 20 more (22 - 20).\nTherefore, the answer is (22)\n\nQ: Tom's fish had fry and 7 were striped. He gave 10 to Jerry and 8 to Kimberly. He now has 15 fry. How many fry did he have to start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, consider the number of fish Tom had originally. Initially, Tom gave away a total of 18 fry (10 to Jerry and 8 to Kimberly). After distributing these fish, he was left with 15 fry. To find out how many fry Tom had initially, we need to add the number of fry he gave away to the number he kept. So, the total initial number of fry is 10 (given to Jerry) + 8 (given to Kimberly) + 15 (remaining with Tom) = 33 fry. This is the total number of fish fry Tom had initially.\nTherefore, the answer is (33)\n\nQ: There were 5 yellow tulips and 9 pink tulips in the garden.
