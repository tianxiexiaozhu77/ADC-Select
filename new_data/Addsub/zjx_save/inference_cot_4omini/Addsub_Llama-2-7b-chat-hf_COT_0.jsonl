Let\'s call this number "x".\n\nWe know that the total number of bales in the barn before Tim stacked any was 28 + x.\n\nNow, we are told that there are 54 bales of hay in the barn now. So, the total number of bales in the barn after Tim stacked some must be 28 + x + 54 = 80.\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\n28 + x + 54 = 80\n\nSolving for "x", we get:\n\nx = 46\n\nSo, Tim stacked 46 bales of hay in the barn.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (5.0). üòä', 'true_answer': ['26']}
