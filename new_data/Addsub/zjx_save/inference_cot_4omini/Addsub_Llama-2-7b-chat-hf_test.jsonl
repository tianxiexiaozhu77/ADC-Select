', 'idx': 0, 'prompt': "Q: Emily found 100 flowers in the garden. She picked some flowers for her mother. Now she has 45 flowers left. How many flowers did she give to her mother?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmily initially has 100 flowers. After picking some flowers for her mother, she has 45 flowers left. To find out how many flowers she gave to her mother, we need to subtract the number of flowers she has left from the number of flowers she started with. Therefore, we calculate 100 - 45 = 55. This means she picked 55 flowers for her mother.\nTherefore, the answer is (55)\n\nQ: Lily had 75 books in her library. She donated some books to the local school. Now she has 40 books remaining. How many books did she donate?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLily started with 75 books in her library. After donating some to the local school, she now has 40 books left. To find out how many books she donated, we subtract the number of books she has remaining from the number of books she originally had. Therefore, we calculate 75 - 40 = 35. This means she donated 35 books.\nTherefore, the answer is (35)\n\nQ: Michael collected 50 baseball cards. He traded some of his cards with Lisa. Now he has 18 baseball cards left. How many baseball cards did he trade with Lisa?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMichael started with 50 baseball cards. After trading with Lisa, he is left with 18 baseball cards. To find out how many cards he traded, we subtract the number of cards he has now from the number he started with: 50 - 18 = 32. This means Michael traded 32 baseball cards with Lisa.\nTherefore, the answer is (32)\n\nQ: Oliver found 30 old coins. He sold some coins to a collector. Now he only has 10 coins left. How many coins did he sell?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nOliver initially had 30 old coins. After selling some coins, he now has 10 coins remaining. To find out how many coins he sold, we can set up the equation: Initial coins - Sold coins = Remaining coins. We know he initially had 30 coins and now has 10 coins left. Therefore, 30 - Sold coins = 10. To find the number of coins sold, we solve for Sold coins: Sold coins = 30 - 10 = 20. Thus, Oliver sold 20 coins.\nTherefore, the answer is (20)\n\nQ: Daniel had 80 stamps in his album. He gave away some stamps to his cousin. He has 30 stamps remaining now.

To find out how many he gave away, we subtract the remaining stamps from the original amount: 80 - 30 = 50. Therefore, Daniel gave away 50 stamps to his cousin.\nTherefore, the answer is (50)\n\nQ: Tom had 90 marbles in his collection. He lost some marbles at school. Now he only has 35 marbles left. How many marbles did he lose?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTom originally had 90 marbles. After losing some, he has 35 marbles left. To find out how many marbles he lost, we subtract the number of marbles he has now from the number he started with. This means we calculate 90 - 35. Performing this calculation gives us 55. Therefore, Tom lost 55 marbles.\nTherefore, the answer is (55)\n\nQ: Sarah baked 40 cookies for the party. She gave some cookies to her friends. Now she has 15 cookies remaining. How many cookies did she give away to her friends?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSarah initially baked 40 cookies. After giving some away, she has 15 cookies remaining.

Therefore, she gave away 25 cookies to her friends.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: Rachel had 60 colored pencils. She lent some of them to her friend. After that, she has 22 colored pencils left. How many colored pencils did she lend to her friend?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nRachel originally had 60 colored pencils. After lending some to her friend, she has 22 colored pencils left. To find out how many colored pencils Rachel lent to her friend, we can calculate the difference between the original number of colored pencils and the number she has left. We subtract the number of pencils remaining (22) from the total she had (60): 60 - 22 = 38. This shows that Rachel lent 38 colored pencils to her friend.\nTherefore, the answer is (38)\n\nQuestion: Joan found 70 seashells on the beach . she gave Sam some of her seashells .
