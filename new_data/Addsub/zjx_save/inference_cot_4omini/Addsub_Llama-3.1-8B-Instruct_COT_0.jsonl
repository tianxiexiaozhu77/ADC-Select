Then, the total amount Benny had before buying the baseball gear is 79 + x dollars.\n\nAfter buying the baseball gear, he had 32 dollars left over. This means that the amount he spent on the baseball gear is the difference between the total amount he had before buying the gear and the amount he had left over.\n\nLet\'s set up an equation to represent this:\n\n79 + x - (amount spent) = 32\n\nWe know that the amount spent is the sum of the cost of the baseball glove, baseball, and bat.

However, we can express the total amount Benny had before buying the baseball gear as 79 + 9x.\n\nWe know that this amount is equal to 79 + x, since the value of the movie tickets is x dollars.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n79 + 9x = 79 + x\n\nSubtracting 79 from both sides gives us:\n\n9x = x\n\nSubtracting x from both sides gives us:\n\n8x = 0\n\nDividing both sides by 8 gives us:\n\nx = 0\n\nThis means that the value of the movie tickets is 0 dollars, which is not possible.
