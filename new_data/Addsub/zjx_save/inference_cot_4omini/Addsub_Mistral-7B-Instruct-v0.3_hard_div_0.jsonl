If there were initially 31 short trees and the workers planted 64 more, there would be 95 short trees, which matches the final number given. But since there are already 32 tall trees in the park, the total number of trees should be 63 (31 short + 32 tall), not 64. So, the workers actually planted 33 short trees (95 - 62, where 62 is the total number of trees after subtracting the 32 tall trees from the initial total of 63 trees).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (33) short trees were planted.", 'true_answer': ['64']}

He gave 2 to his friends . He now has 6 puppies . How many puppies did he have to start with ? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "Sam started with the total number of puppies he has now (6) plus the number of puppies he gave away (2), minus the number of puppies that have spots (8, since he only gave away the spotted ones). So the calculation would be 6 + 2 - 8 = 4. However, this doesn't make sense because Sam can't have fewer puppies than the number of spotted puppies he gave away.\n\nIt seems there might be a mistake in the question. If we assume that Sam gave away some non-spotted puppies as well, then the calculation would be correct. For example, if Sam had 10 puppies to start with, gave away 2 spotted ones, and 2 non-spotted ones, he would be left with 6 non-spotted puppies. In this case, the answer would be (10). But without more information about the non-spotted puppies, it's impossible to determine the exact number of puppies Sam had to start with.", 'true_answer': ['8']}
