What fraction of the apartments are either 1 - or two-bedroom apartments ? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "To determine the fraction of apartments that are either one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments, we need to add the fractions of one-bedroom apartments and two-bedroom apartments together. The fraction of one-bedroom apartments is \\(0.16666666666666666\\) and the fraction of two-bedroom apartments is \\(0.3333333333333333\\).\n\nFirst, let's convert these decimal numbers to fractions. The decimal \\(0.16666666666666666\\) is equivalent to \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) and the decimal \\(0.3333333333333333\\) is equivalent to \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nNext, we need to add these two fractions together. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator of 6 and 3 is 6. We can rewrite \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) as \\(\\frac{2}{6}\\).\n\nNow, we can add the fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1 + 2}{6} = \\frac{3}{6}\n\\]\n\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{3}{6}\\) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{3 \\div 3}{6 \\div 3} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the fraction of apartments that are either one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).", 'true_answer': ['0.5']}

How much longer was the green caterpillar than the orange caterpillar ? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': 'To determine how much longer the green caterpillar is than the orange caterpillar, we need to subtract the length of the orange caterpillar from the length of the green caterpillar. The length of the green caterpillar is 3 inches, and the length of the orange caterpillar is 1.1666666666666667 inches. We can write this as:\n\n\\[ 3 - 1.1666666666666667 \\]\n\nTo perform the subtraction, it is helpful to convert the repeating decimal 1.1666666666666667 to a fraction. The repeating decimal 1.1666666666666667 is equivalent to \\(1 \\frac{1}{6}\\) or \\(\\frac{7}{6}\\). Therefore, we can rewrite the subtraction as:\n\n\\[ 3 - \\frac{7}{6} \\]\n\nTo subtract these, we need a common denominator. The number 3 can be written as \\(\\frac{18}{6}\\). So the subtraction becomes:\n\n\\[ \\frac{18}{6} - \\frac{7}{6} = \\frac{18 - 7}{6} = \\frac{11}{6} \\]\n\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{11}{6}\\) can be converted back to a decimal, which is approximately 1.8333333333333333. However, the exact value is \\(\\frac{11}{6}\\), which is the simplest form.
