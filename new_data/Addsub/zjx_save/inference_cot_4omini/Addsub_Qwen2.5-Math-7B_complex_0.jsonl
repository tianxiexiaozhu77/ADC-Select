Then she sawed 0.33 meters off the end . How long is the piece of wood now ? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "The carpenter initially had a piece of wood that was 0.41 meters long. She then sawed off 0.33 meters from the end. To find the new length of the piece of wood, we need to subtract the length sawed off from the original length. So, the new length of the piece of wood is \\(0.41 - 0.33 = 0.08\\) meters. Let's confirm this with Python code.\n```python\n# Initial length of the wood\ninitial_length = 0.41\n\n# Length sawed off\nsawed_length = 0.33\n\n# New length of the wood\nnew_length = initial_length - sawed_length\nprint(new_length)\n```\n```output\n0.07999999999999996\n```\nThe new length of the piece of wood is \\(0.08\\) meters. The slight discrepancy in the result is due to floating-point precision, but the correct answer is indeed \\(0.08\\) meters.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{0.08}\\).", 'true_answer': ['0.08']}
