How many babies did he have to start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet's denote the initial number of babies John had as X. He gave away 5 babies to Anna and 3 babies to Tom, which totals 8 babies given away. After giving these away, John ended up with 2 babies remaining. Therefore, we can set up the equation: X - 8 = 2.

One cat consumes 0.2 scoop of cat food, while the other two cats each consume 0.1 scoop. To find the total, we can follow this calculation: The first cat eats 0.2 scoop, and the other two cats eat 0.1 scoop each, which totals to 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 scoop for the two cats. Now, we add the consumption of all three cats: 0.2 scoop (first cat) + 0.2 scoop (two cats) = 0.2 + 0.2 = 0.4 scoop of cat food in total per day for all three cats.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.4).)\n\nQ: Nina's horse had foals and 3 had white patches.

After counting, they found that 3 were too small to keep. How many fish did they catch altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find the total number of fish caught by Hannah, Ethan, and Mia. This can be done by adding the number of fish each person caught: 11 (Hannah) + 8 (Ethan) + 6 (Mia) = 25 fish altogether. However, we learned that 3 of these fish were too small to keep. To find how many fish they caught that were keepable, we subtract the 3 small fish from the total caught: 25 - 3 = 22 keepable fish. Since the question asks how many fish they caught altogether, we focus on the initial total without subtracting the small fish. Therefore, the answer is the total fish initially caught, which is 25.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: James gathered 12 rocks, Emily gathered 7 rocks, and Ben gathered 4 rocks by the river.

Karen gathered 30 rocks and Mike gathered 25 rocks. To calculate the total, we add these two amounts together: 30 + 25 = 55. The number of broken rocks does not affect the total amount collected, so we can ignore that detail for this calculation. Therefore, the total number of rocks collected together is 55.\nTherefore, the answer is (55)\n\nQ: Alex caught 29 fish and Jamie caught 11 fish in the lake. After counting them, they realized that 10 were too small to keep.

Greg brought cats into the shelter today. There are now 70 cats in the shelter. How many cats did he bring into the shelter?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 20 cats in the shelter. After Greg brought in some cats, the total number of cats in the shelter increased to 70. To find out how many cats Greg brought in, we can set up the equation: initial cats in shelter + cats brought in = total cats in shelter. This translates to: 20 + x = 70, where x is the number of cats Greg brought in. By solving for x, we subtract 20 from both sides: x = 70 - 20. Therefore, x = 50. This means Greg brought in 50 cats to the shelter.\nTherefore, the answer is (50)\n\nQ: Emma picked 90 berries and 15 flowers from the garden. She gave Noah some of her berries.
