They finished in second place for 3 of those events. To find out how many events they won, we first need to determine how many events they did not win or finish second in. If they excelled in the majority of their races, it implies they won more than half of the events. Since half of 9 is 4.5, the majority would mean they won at least 5 events. However, if they finished second in 3 of them, then we should subtract those from the total to find the number of events they could potentially have won. Therefore, they won 9 (total events) - 3 (events they finished second in) = 6 events.

{'question': 'Joan went to 4 football games this year . She went to 9 games last year . How many football games did Joan go to in all ? ', 'idx': 7, 'prompt': "Q: Sophia's cheerleading squad performed in 10 competitions this season. They garnered top placements in most of these events. They were placed second in 2 competitions. How many competitions did they win?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many competitions Sophia's cheerleading squad won, we start with the total number of competitions, which is 10. According to the information given, they placed second in 2 of these competitions. This implies that they did not win these 2 competitions. Therefore, to find out how many they won, we subtract the number of competitions where they placed second from the total competitions: 10 total competitions - 2 second placements = 8 competitions. Now, we need to assume that the remaining competitions are wins since it's stated they garnered top placements in most events.

They emerged victorious in the majority of the games. They lost 5 matches. How many matches did they win?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many matches Michael's soccer team won, we first need to determine how many matches they did not lose. The team played a total of 18 matches and lost 5. The number of matches they either won or drew is given by subtracting the number of losses from the total matches played: 18 - 5 = 13. Since the problem states that they emerged victorious in the majority of the games, they must have won more matches than they lost. Therefore, if they have lost 5 matches, to have won the majority of the matches, they must have won at least 10 matches, which is the case since 13 matches are left to win or draw. Hence, the total number of wins is the remaining matches which they won. After determining the losses and the total matches, we can confirm that they won 13 - 5 = 8 matches alone, so the outcome will not reach 10 wins, thus validating they won 10 matches exactly, making it the maximum. Hence, finally we can confirm that they won 13 matches with 10 being the ideal outcome over the available math.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Emily's track team took part in 9 events this season. They excelled in the majority of their races. They finished in second place for 3 events. How many events did they win?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe track team participated in a total of 9 events. They finished in second place in 3 of those events. To find out how many events they won, we first note that 'excelling in the majority of races' implies that they must have finished first in more events than they finished in second place. Since there were 3 second-place finishes, the team must have won more than 3 events to have a majority. Therefore, we can calculate the number of wins by subtracting the second-place finishes from the total events: 9 events - 3 second-place finishes = 6 potential events left. However, they must have at least 4 wins to surpass the 3 second-place finishes. Thus, they won 6 - 3 = 6 events, as this satisfies the condition of having a majority of wins. So, they won 6 events in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: Emily had 15 strawberries in her kitchen. She went to the garden and picked more strawberries, ending up with 45.

To find out how many tournaments they won, we subtract the number of lost tournaments from the total number of tournaments held. This can be calculated as follows: 15 total tournaments - 4 lost tournaments = 11 won tournaments. Since they were victorious in the majority of the tournaments, it confirms that they won more than half of the tournaments. The majority of 15 is more than 7.5, and since they won 11 tournaments, this meets the criteria for a majority.\nTherefore, the answer is (11)\n\nQ: Ethan's baseball team played 20 games this year.

How many maple trees will the forest have when the workers are finished?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nStart with the current number of maple trees, which is 12. Today, workers will add 4 more trees, so we add 4 to 12. This gives us 12 + 4 = 16 trees after today. Tomorrow, they will plant another 6 trees, so we add 6 to 16.

Foresters will plant pine trees today. When the foresters are finished there will be 40 pine trees in the forest. How many pine trees did the foresters plant today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there are 10 pine trees in the forest. The foresters will add an unknown number of trees, let's call this number X. After planting, the total number of pine trees will be 40. We can set up the equation: 10 + X = 40. To find X, we subtract 10 from both sides: X = 40 - 10. This gives us X = 30. Thus, the foresters planted 30 pine trees today.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\n\n\nQ: There are 80 pine trees currently in the forest. Forestry workers will plant 20 pine trees next month. How many pine trees will the forest have when the workers are finished?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the number of pine trees currently in the forest, which is 80. Next, we will add the number of pine trees that will be planted by the forestry workers, which is 20. To find the total number of pine trees after the planting is complete, we need to add these two numbers together: 80 + 20. This gives us 100.

How many maple trees did the staff plant today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nCurrently, there are 12 maple trees in the park. The staff plans to increase the total number of maple trees to 50. To find out how many trees they will plant, we need to subtract the current number of trees from the target number of trees. Therefore, we calculate: 50 (target number) - 12 (current number) = 38 (number of trees to be planted).\nTherefore, the answer is (38)\n\nQ: There are 15 pine trees currently in the yard. Yard workers will plant 7 pine trees today and 5 pine trees tomorrow. How many pine trees will the yard have when the workers are finished?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the current number of pine trees, which is 15. Today, the workers will plant an additional 7 pine trees. So, we first add 7 to 15: 15 + 7 = 22. Then, tomorrow, they will plant another 5 pine trees. We add 5 to the current total: 22 + 5 = 27. Therefore, the total number of pine trees after both days of planting is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27)\n\nQ: There are 100 maple trees currently in the park. Park staff will plant 30 maple trees next year. How many maple trees will the park have when the staff is finished?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nCurrently, there are 100 maple trees in the park. Staff will plant an additional 30 maple trees next year. To find the total number of maple trees after planting, we need to add the number of existing trees to the number of new trees that will be planted. Therefore, we calculate: 100 (current trees) + 30 (new trees) = 130. Thus, the park will have a total of 130 maple trees after the staff is finished planting.\nTherefore, the answer is (130)\n\nQuestion: Joan picked 43 apples from the orchard , and gave 27 apples to Melanie .

According to the problem, she played 22 games this year but missed 17 games. We can't add the missed games because they don't count as played games, so we only consider the 22 games she played. Also, we find that she participated in 9 games last year, but since the question pertains to the current year only, we do not add these to the total for this year.

How many books did he place on the shelf?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 120 books on the shelf. After Mark added more books, the total number of books on the shelf became 150. To find out how many books Mark added, we can set up the equation: 120 (initial books) + X (books added) = 150 (total books). To solve for X, we subtract 120 from both sides: X = 150 - 120. Performing the subtraction gives us X = 30. Therefore, Mark placed 30 books on the shelf.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\nQ: There were 15 books on the shelf. Sarah added some books to the shelf today. There are now 37 books on the shelf. How many books did she add to the shelf?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 15 books on the shelf. After Sarah added some books, the total number of books increased to 37. To find out how many books Sarah added, we subtract the initial number of books from the new total. This can be calculated as follows: 37 (total books now) - 15 (initial books) = 22. Therefore, Sarah added 22 books to the shelf.\nTherefore, the answer is (22)\n\nQ: Sara has 88 books on her shelf, and she lent 24 books to her siblings. How many books does she have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSara originally has 88 books. She lent 24 books to her siblings. To find out how many books she has left, we need to subtract the number of books she lent from the total number of books she originally had. So, we calculate 88 - 24. Performing the subtraction, we find that 88 - 24 equals 64. Therefore, after lending the books, Sara has 64 books left.\nTherefore, the answer is (64)\n\nQuestion: A multi-national corporation has 2041 part-time employees and 63093 full-time employees .

How many marbles did they find in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many marbles Olivia and Noah found individually. Olivia discovered 40 marbles, and Noah found 25 marbles. To find the total number of marbles they discovered, we add the two quantities together. So, 40 (Olivia's marbles) + 25 (Noah's marbles) equals a total of 65 marbles. The number of chipped marbles (10) does not affect the total count of marbles they found. Therefore, the total number of marbles they found is 65.\nTherefore, the answer is (65)\n\nQ: There were 100 stickers in the collection. Mark received some stickers as a gift today. There are now 150 stickers in the collection. How many stickers did he receive?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 100 stickers in the collection. After Mark received some stickers, the total became 150 stickers. To find out how many stickers Mark received, we can set up the equation: Initial stickers + Received stickers = Total stickers. Thus, we have 100 + Received stickers = 150.

Out of these, 25,000 moved to the city. Assuming that these 25,000 students were already enrolled in schools elsewhere before moving, we can see that they do not represent new enrollments in the schools in the city. Therefore, since we have no data about new enrollments specific to the city, we can conclude that the number of new students attending schools in the city last year is equal to the number of students who moved there, which is 25,000.\nTherefore, the answer is (25,000)\n\nQ: Last year, 5000 tourists visited the island, and 800 foreigners relocated there.

How many tons of sand does the barge carry now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the barge carries 15000 tons of sand. Workers then add 4500 tons of sand to the barge. To find the total amount of sand the barge carries now, we need to perform the following calculation: 15000 tons + 4500 tons. This equals 19500 tons.

By the time the boat is afloat again, 200 fish have escaped. Only 30 fish are still in the net. How many fish were originally caught by the boat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the total number of fish originally caught by the boat be represented as 'x'. When the boat hits the sandbank, 200 fish escape. After this, 30 fish remain in the net. Therefore, the number of fish that escaped plus the number of fish still in the net must equal the original number of fish caught. This gives us the equation: x - 200 + 30 = x. Simplifying this, we have: x - 200 + 30 = x, which simplifies to 30 - 200 = 0. This implies that the original amount of fish caught is 200 + 30 = 230. Thus, the boat originally caught a total of 230 fish.\nTherefore, the answer is (230)\n\nQ: A yacht filled with luxury goods wrecks near an island. By the time the yacht is salvaged, 300 crates of goods are lost at sea. Only 50 crates remain onboard. How many crates of goods did the yacht originally have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the original number of crates, we need to consider the crates that were lost and the crates that remain. We know that 300 crates were lost at sea and 50 crates are still onboard. Therefore, to find the original number of crates, we add the lost crates to the crates that remain. This gives us: Original number of crates = Lost crates + Remaining crates = 300 + 50 = 350.\nTherefore, the answer is (350)\n\nQ: A cargo ship contains 7800 metric tons of supplies. At a port, more supplies weighing 9200 metric tons are added on. What is the total weight of supplies on the ship now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total weight of supplies on the cargo ship, we need to add the initial weight of supplies and the additional supplies. The initial weight is 7800 metric tons and the additional weight is 9200 metric tons. Therefore, we perform the addition: 7800 + 9200. This equals 17000 metric tons. Thus, the total weight of supplies on the ship is 17000 metric tons.\nTherefore, the answer is (17000)\n\n\n\nQ: A toxic waste container cracked open. Before the cleanup team could arrive, 2200 liters of waste spilled onto the soil. While they were dealing with the situation, 1500 more liters spilled. In total, how many liters of toxic waste were released?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total amount of toxic waste released, we need to add the two amounts that were spilled. The first spill was 2200 liters and the second spill was 1500 liters. We perform the addition: 2200 + 1500 = 3700. Therefore, the total amount of toxic waste released is 3700 liters.\nTherefore, the answer is (3700)\n\nQ: A tank ruptured at a hazardous material facility. Prior to the containment efforts, 8900 liters of toxic substance spilled onto the ground. While containment was underway, another 7200 liters spilled out. What is the total amount of toxic substance that spilled?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total amount of toxic substance that spilled, we need to add the two amounts of spills together. The first spill is 8900 liters, and the second spill is 7200 liters. Therefore, we calculate: 8900 + 7200. First, we add 8900 and 7200. Performing the addition gives us: 8900 + 7200 = 16100 liters. Thus, the total amount of toxic substance that spilled is 16100 liters.\nTherefore, the answer is (16100)\n\nQ: A cargo train loaded with coal hits a bridge. By the time the train is back on track, 980 tons of coal have fallen off. Only 220 tons of coal are left in the train. How many tons of coal did the train originally carry?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the original amount of coal the train carried, we need to consider both the coal that has fallen off the train and the coal that is still on the train. We know that 980 tons of coal fell off and 220 tons are left in the train. Therefore, the original weight of coal can be calculated by summing the weight lost and the weight remaining: 980 tons (fallen) + 220 tons (remaining) = 1200 tons. Thus, the train originally carried 1200 tons of coal.\nTherefore, the answer is (1200)\n\nQ: An oil tanker encountered a leak. Before the crew could fix it, 8950 liters of oil spilled into the harbor. While repairs were ongoing, another 6700 liters leaked out. What is the total amount of oil that was spilled into the harbor?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total amount of oil that was spilled into the harbor, we need to add the amount of oil from the first leak and the amount from the second leak. The first leak released 8950 liters of oil, and while repairs were ongoing, an additional 6700 liters leaked out. We calculate the total by performing the addition: 8950 liters + 6700 liters = 15650 liters. Hence, the total amount of oil spilled is 15650 liters.\nTherefore, the answer is (15650)\n\nQuestion: Eve ran 0.7 mile and walked 0.6 mile .

She cleaned 57 rooms on the first floor. To find out how many rooms she cleaned on the other floors, we need to subtract the number of rooms cleaned on the first floor from the total number of rooms cleaned. So, we calculate: 145 - 57 = 88.

She donated some quilts to the local shelter, and now she has 12 quilts left. To find out how many quilts she donated, we can set up the equation: Initial quilts - Donated quilts = Remaining quilts. This can be rewritten as: 30 - Donated quilts = 12. To find the number of donated quilts, we rearrange the equation: Donated quilts = 30 - 12. Calculating this gives us 30 - 12 = 18. Therefore, Chloe donated 18 quilts to the local shelter.\nTherefore, the answer is (18)\n\nQ: A school has collected a total of 8650 cans for charity this year.

First, we convert the fractions to a common format by adding them directly: 0.2 + 0.5 = 0.7. Next, we interpret this decimal fraction as a total portion of their budget. Therefore, the fraction of their budget spent on education and savings together is 0.7, which can also be expressed as 7/10 or 70%. Hence, we simply present this total in decimal format as required.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.7).)\n\nQ: 0.6 of the students in the choir are in the soprano section. 0.15 of the students in the choir are in the alto section. What fraction of the students in the choir are in either the soprano section or the alto section?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the fraction of students in either the soprano or alto section, we start by adding the fractions of students in each section. The fraction of students in the soprano section is 0.6 and the fraction of students in the alto section is 0.15. We can calculate the total by performing the addition: 0.6 + 0.15. First, we convert these decimals into fractions if needed. 0.6 can be expressed as 6/10 and 0.15 can be expressed as 15/100. To add these, we can convert them to a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 100 is 100. Thus, we convert 0.6 (6/10) to 60/100. Now we add: 60/100 + 15/100 = 75/100. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 25. This simplification gives us 3/4. Therefore, the fraction of students in either the soprano or alto section is 3/4.\nTherefore, the answer is ((0.75))\n\nQ: In Mr. Johnson's history class, 0.75 of the students obtained A grades and 0.1 received B grades. What fraction of the students received either A grades or B grades?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the fraction of students who received either A or B grades, we need to add the fractions of students who received A grades and B grades together. The fraction of students who received A grades is 0.75 and the fraction of students who received B grades is 0.1. First, we convert these decimal fractions into a common format to add them. We can convert 0.75 to a fraction, which is 75/100, or simplify that to 3/4. The decimal 0.1 also converts to a fraction as 1/10. Now, we need to add these two fractions together. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 10 is 20. Thus, we convert each fraction: (3/4) becomes (15/20) and (1/10) becomes (2/20). Now we add these: (15/20) + (2/20) = (17/20). Therefore, 17/20 of the students received either A or B grades.\nTherefore, the answer is ((0.85))\n\nQuestion: Hoping to be named Salesperson of the Month , Rosa called the names from 10.2 pages of the phone book last week .

Now that Brian has adopted a third turtle, he needs to serve a total of 1 can each day. How much extra food is needed to feed the third turtle?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Brian had 2 turtles and needed to serve 0.5 can of turtle food each day. This means that for 2 turtles, the daily food requirement was 0.5 can. The amount of food per turtle is calculated as follows: 0.5 can / 2 turtles = 0.25 can per turtle per day. When Brian adopted a third turtle, the total daily food requirement increased to 1 can for 3 turtles. We can calculate the new amount of food per turtle as follows: 1 can / 3 turtles = 0.333... can per turtle. To find out how much extra food is needed for the third turtle, we subtract the original amount per turtle from the new amount per turtle: 0.333... can - 0.25 can = 0.083... can. This means that the third turtle needs approximately 0.083... can extra per day. When considering food in practical terms, rounding to a suitable measurement may vary, but in precise terms, extra food needed for the third turtle is approximately 0.083 can per day.\nTherefore, the answer is ((0.083))\n\nQ: Mark has 3 cats. Each day, 1 cat eats 0.2 scoop of cat food and the other two cats each eat 0.2 scoop. Together, how much cat food do the 3 cats eat each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by the 3 cats, we first note the food consumption per cat. Each cat consumes 0.2 scoops of cat food. Since there are 3 cats, we can calculate the total consumption by adding the food eaten by each cat: 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 = 0.6 scoops. Therefore, together, the 3 cats eat a total of 0.6 scoops of cat food each day.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.6).)\n\n\n\nQ: When Anna had 1 guinea pig, she needed to serve 0.6 cups of guinea pig food each day. Now that Anna has adopted a second guinea pig, she needs to serve a total of 1.1 cups each day. How much extra food is needed to feed the second guinea pig?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nAnna initially needed 0.6 cups of food for one guinea pig. After adopting a second guinea pig, the total food requirement increased to 1.1 cups per day. To find out how much extra food is needed for the second guinea pig, we subtract the initial food amount (0.6 cups) from the new total (1.1 cups). This gives us 1.1 - 0.6 = 0.5 cups. Therefore, the extra food needed to feed the second guinea pig is 0.5 cups.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.5).)\n\nQ: When Tom had 3 fish, he needed to serve 0.3 cans of fish food every day. Now that Tom has adopted a fourth fish, he needs to serve a total of 0.6 cans each day. How much extra food is needed to feed the fourth fish?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how much fish food Tom was using for each fish initially. When Tom had 3 fish, he served 0.3 cans of fish food every day. Therefore, the food per fish was 0.3 cans divided by 3 fish, which equals 0.1 cans per fish. Now, after adopting a fourth fish, Tom serves 0.6 cans of food per day. We can again divide the total food (0.6 cans) by the number of fish (4) to find how much food is needed per fish now, which equals 0.6 cans divided by 4 fish, resulting in 0.15 cans per fish. To find the extra food needed for the fourth fish, we can subtract the original amount of food per fish (0.1 cans) from the new amount (0.15 cans): 0.15 - 0.1 = 0.05 cans. Therefore, he needs an extra 0.05 cans of food to feed the fourth fish.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.05).)\n\nQ: When Mark had 1 rabbit, he needed to serve 0.2 pounds of rabbit food each day. Now that Mark has adopted a second rabbit, he needs to serve a total of 0.5 pounds each day. How much extra food is needed to feed the second rabbit?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMark initially needed 0.2 pounds of rabbit food for 1 rabbit. After adopting a second rabbit, he now needs a total of 0.5 pounds of food each day. To find out how much extra food is needed for the second rabbit, we will take the total amount of food for 2 rabbits and subtract the amount needed for 1 rabbit. The calculation is as follows: 0.5 pounds (total for 2 rabbits) - 0.2 pounds (for the first rabbit) = 0.3 pounds. This means that the second rabbit requires an additional 0.3 pounds of food daily.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.3).)\n\nQ: When Sarah had 2 birds, she needed to serve 0.4 can of birdseed each day. Now that Sarah has adopted a third bird, she needs to serve a total of 0.7 can each day. How much extra food is needed to feed the third bird?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine how much birdseed Sarah needed for 2 birds, which was 0.4 can per day. Then we note that after adopting a third bird, the total requirement increased to 0.7 can per day. To find the extra food needed for the third bird, we subtract the initial amount required for 2 birds from the new total amount needed. Therefore, the extra birdseed needed is 0.7 can (for 3 birds) minus 0.4 can (for 2 birds), which results in 0.3 can. Thus, the extra food needed to feed the third bird is 0.3 can.\nTherefore, the answer is (0.3)\n\nQuestion: In March it rained 0.81 inches . It rained 0.35 inches less in April than in March .

The gardeners then remove 12 of these maple trees due to infection. To find out how many maple trees remain, we subtract the number of trees removed from the original total. Therefore, we calculate 45 - 12, which results in 33 maple trees left in the garden after the removal.\nTherefore, the answer is (33)\n\nQ: There are 12 maple trees currently in the park. Park staff will plant maple trees today. When the staff are finished there will be 50 maple trees in the park. How many maple trees did the staff plant today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nCurrently, there are 12 maple trees in the park. The park staff will plant more maple trees, and the goal is to have a total of 50 maple trees. To determine how many trees need to be planted, we subtract the current number of trees (12) from the desired total (50). Therefore, the calculation is 50 - 12. This gives us the number of trees that need to be planted today.\nTherefore, the answer is (38)\n\nQ: There are 20 spruce trees currently in the nursery. Workers will plant spruce trees today. When the workers are finished there will be 60 spruce trees in the nursery. How many spruce trees did the workers plant today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with 20 spruce trees in the nursery. The workers will plant more trees today, which will increase the total number of spruce trees to 60. To find out how many trees the workers planted, we need to subtract the current number of trees from the total number of trees after planting. Therefore, we calculate: 60 (total trees after planting) - 20 (current trees) = 40 (trees planted).\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: Initially, there were 4500 trees in the urban area. After a reforestation program, workers planted 20000 new trees. How many trees are in the urban area now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of trees in the urban area after the reforestation program, we start with the initial number of trees, which is 4500. Then, we add the number of new trees that were planted, which is 20000. This can be expressed mathematically as: Total trees = Initial trees + Planted trees. Thus, Total trees = 4500 + 20000. Performing the addition gives us 24500. Therefore, the total number of trees in the urban area now is 24500.\nTherefore, the answer is (24500)\n\n\n\nQ: There are 80 pine trees currently in the forest. Forestry workers will plant 20 pine trees next month. How many pine trees will the forest have when the workers are finished?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nCurrently, there are 80 pine trees in the forest. Next month, the forestry workers will plant an additional 20 pine trees. To find the total number of pine trees after planting, we need to add the number of existing trees (80) to the number of new trees being planted (20). Performing the addition: 80 + 20 = 100. Therefore, after planting, the forest will have a total of 100 pine trees.\nTherefore, the answer is (100)\n\nQ: There are 12 maple trees currently in the forest. Forest workers will plant 4 maple trees today and 6 maple trees tomorrow. How many maple trees will the forest have when the workers are finished?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nStart with the current number of maple trees in the forest, which is 12. The workers will plant 4 maple trees today, so we add 4 to the current total: 12 + 4 = 16. Then, tomorrow, they will plant an additional 6 maple trees, so we add 6 to the previous total: 16 + 6 = 22. Therefore, when the workers are finished, the total number of maple trees in the forest will be 22.\nTherefore, the answer is (22)\n\nQ: There are 15 orange trees currently in the grove. Workers will plant orange trees today. When the workers are finished there will be 48 orange trees in the grove. How many orange trees did the workers plant today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many orange trees the workers planted today, we start by identifying the number of trees already in the grove, which is 15. The goal is to reach a total of 48 orange trees. We can find out how many trees were planted by subtracting the current number from the target number: 48 (target) - 15 (current) = 33. Therefore, the workers planted 33 orange trees today.\nTherefore, the answer is (33)\n\nQ: There are 100 maple trees currently in the park. Park staff will plant 30 maple trees next year.

They lost 4 games. How many games did they win?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that Sophia's lacrosse team played a total of 14 games. They lost 4 games. To find out how many games they won, we need to subtract the number of games lost from the total number of games played. This gives us the formula: Wins = Total Games - Losses. Plugging in the numbers: Wins = 14 - 4, which equals 10. The problem states that they claimed victory in the majority of their games. For them to have won the majority, they would need to have won more than half of the games played. Half of 14 is 7, and since they won 10 games, which is greater than 7, they actually did win a majority of their games. Therefore, the total number of games they won is 10.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Sophia's middle school hosted 512 soccer matches this year, 90 of which took place indoors.

The gardeners need to remove 5 dead apple trees. To find out how many apple trees will remain, we subtract the number of dead apple trees from the initial count of apple trees: 30 - 5 = 25. Therefore, there will be 25 apple trees remaining in the orchard after the gardeners finish their work.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: Sara had 45 apples in her basket.

After picking more apples at the farm, she now has a total of 102 apples. To find out how many apples she picked, we need to subtract the number of apples she initially had from the total number of apples she has now.

How many apples were gathered in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of apples gathered, we need to add the number of apples gathered by Alex, Jamie, and Taylor. First, we identify the number of apples each person collected: Alex gathered 5 apples, Jamie gathered 8 apples, and Taylor gathered 2 apples. We then perform the addition: 5 (Alex) + 8 (Jamie) + 2 (Taylor). First, we add 5 and 8, which gives us 13. Next, we add 2 to 13, resulting in a total of 15 apples collected. Therefore, the total number of apples gathered is 15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\n\n\nQ: Linda picked 60 fruits and 5 vegetables from the garden. She shared some of her fruits with Rachel. Now, she has 30 fruits left. How many fruits did she share with Rachel?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLinda initially picked 60 fruits. After sharing some fruits with Rachel, she has 30 fruits left. To find out how many fruits she shared, we can set up the equation: Initial fruits - Shared fruits = Remaining fruits. This translates to 60 - Shared fruits = 30. To solve for the number of shared fruits, we can rearrange the equation: Shared fruits = 60 - 30. Therefore, Shared fruits = 30.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\nQ: Sarah picked 12 berries and Mike picked 34 berries from the garden. When they sorted them, they found that 8 were spoiled.

So we calculate 12 + 34 = 46 berries. The number of spoiled berries does not affect the total number they picked together; it just tells us that out of the total berries, some were not good to eat. Therefore, the total number of berries picked by Sarah and Mike combined is 46.\nTherefore, the answer is (46)\n\nQ: Michael's tree grew 15 apples. He picked 6 of them. How many apples are still on the tree?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMichael's tree initially had 15 apples.

After gathering more pears from the tree, she now has a total of 150 pears. To find out how many pears she gathered, we can subtract the initial amount from the final amount. So, we calculate: 150 pears (final amount) - 60 pears (initial amount) = 90 pears. Therefore, Nina gathered 90 pears from the tree.\nTherefore, the answer is (90)\n\nQuestion: Alyssa picked 17 plums and Jason picked 10 plums . Melanie picked 35 pears .

The diner cooked 6 burgers during the day and 4 burgers during the night, which totals to 6 + 4 = 10 burgers. Adding the 1 burger cooked yesterday results in 10 + 1 = 11 burgers cooked in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (11)\n\nQ: Michael baked 4 pies this month. He baked 6 pies last month, and plans to bake 9 pies next month. How many pies will he bake altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pies Michael will bake altogether, we need to sum the number of pies he baked in the past and the number he plans to bake in the future. Last month, Michael baked 6 pies. This month, he baked 4 pies. Next month, he plans to bake 9 pies. We can calculate the total by adding these three values together: 6 (last month) + 4 (this month) + 9 (next month). Performing the addition: 6 + 4 = 10, and then, 10 + 9 = 19. Thus, the total number of pies baked is 19.\nTherefore, the answer is (19)\n\n\n\nQ: A cafeteria worker counted leftover meals on Friday night.
