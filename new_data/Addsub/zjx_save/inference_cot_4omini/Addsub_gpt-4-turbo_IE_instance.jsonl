', 'idx': 35, 'prompt': "Q: Ava's lacrosse team participated in 22 games this year. The team achieved victories in more than half of their games. They faced setbacks in 9 games. How many games did they win?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nAva's lacrosse team participated in 22 games total. Since they won more than half, we first calculate half of 22, which is 11. Winning more than half means they must have won at least 12 games. The team faced setbacks in 9 games, which means they lost 9 games. To find out how many games they won, we subtract the number of games lost from the total games played. Therefore, the number of games won can be calculated as 22 (total games) - 9 (lost games) = 13.

They lost 5 matches, which means they had to win the remaining matches to have a majority. To calculate the number of matches they won, we first find the total matches minus the lost matches: 15 - 5 = 10 matches. A majority means winning more than half. Half of 15 is 7.5, thus they need to win more than 7 matches to have the majority. Winning 10 matches gives them a majority as 10 > 7.5. Therefore, they won 10 matches.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Mia picked 45 berries and Noah found 35 berries in the field. When they sorted them out, they discovered that 12 were spoiled.

{'question': 'Jason went to 11 football games this month . He went to 17 games last month , and plans to go to 16 games next month . How many games will he attend in all ? ', 'idx': 54, 'prompt': "Q: Liam's football team played 11 games this season. The team won the majority of their matches. They were defeated in 3 games. How many games did they win?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe football team played a total of 11 games. They won the majority of their matches, which means they won more than half of them. Half of 11 is 5.5, so winning the majority would require at least 6 wins. The team was defeated in 3 games. To find the total number of wins, we subtract the number of defeats from the total games: 11 total games - 3 defeats = 8 wins. Since 8 is greater than 6, this means the team did win the majority of their matches. Therefore, the number of games they won is 8.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: Jacob's hockey team played 14 games this season. The team emerged victorious in the majority of their games.

To find out how many games they won, we need to subtract the number of games lost from the total number of games played. So, we calculate: 14 total games - 4 lost games = 10 won games. Since they emerged victorious in the majority of their games, winning 10 games out of 14 confirms this. Therefore, the number of games they won is 10.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Alex attended 20 basketball matches this season. He went to 35 matches last season.

The team triumphed in the majority of their games. They lost 5 matches. How many matches did they win?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nKevin's soccer team played a total of 15 matches. We know they lost 5 matches. To find out how many matches they won, we first subtract the number of matches lost from the total matches. Therefore, 15 - 5 = 10. Now, since the team triumphed in the majority of their games, this means they must have won more than half the matches. Half of 15 is 7.5, so the team needs to win at least 8 matches to have won the majority. Since they lost 5 matches, this means they actually won 10 matches, which is greater than 7.5. Thus, it confirms they won the majority of their matches.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Jordan went to 16 hockey games this season. Last year, Jordan attended 22 games.

This means we take the number of games from this season, which is 16, and add it to the number from last year, which is 22. Thus, we calculate 16 + 22. Performing this addition gives us 38. Therefore, the total number of hockey games attended by Jordan is 38.\nTherefore, the answer is (38)\n\nQ: Michael's baseball team played 20 games this season. The team secured victory in more than half of their matches. They faced defeat in 8 games. How many games did they win?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMichael's baseball team played a total of 20 games and lost 8 of them. To find out how many games they won, we subtract the number of losses from the total games played. So, 20 (total games) - 8 (losses) = 12 (wins).

The total oil initially carried by the tanker can be determined by summing the spilled oil and the remaining oil. The tanker spilled 5000 gallons into the ocean and has 1000 gallons left. Therefore, the initial amount of oil can be calculated as 5000 gallons (spilled) + 1000 gallons (remaining) = 6000 gallons. Thus, the oil tanker initially carried 6000 gallons of oil.\nTherefore, the answer is (6000)\n\nQ: A container ship faced a storm at sea.

Let X be the original number of containers. According to the problem, 650 containers fell overboard, and 250 containers are still on the ship after that. This can be expressed as: X - 650 = 250. Now, to solve for X, we add 650 to both sides of the equation: X = 250 + 650. Therefore, X = 900. Hence, the ship originally transported 900 containers.\nTherefore, the answer is (900)\n\nQuestion: A ship full of grain crashes into a coral reef .

The number of new births was 34567. The number of people who transferred in was 5678. We are assuming no one left the district, so we can simply add the new births to the new transfers. Therefore, the total additional residents can be calculated as: 34567 (new births) + 5678 (transfers) = 40245. This means that last year the district gained a total of 40245 additional residents.\nTherefore, the answer is (40245)\n\nQ: Last year, 75345 individuals were born in a region, and 12045 people moved in. How many new residents began living in the region last year?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the number of new residents that began living in the region last year, we need to consider both births and the number of people moving into the area. Last year, there were 75345 births and 12045 people who moved in. However, the question asks specifically for the new residents 'began living', which typically implies people who moved in but doesn't require counting those who were born, as they were already residents of the region. Therefore, we only count the individuals who moved in. Thus, the new residents from moving in is simply 12045. Therefore, the total number of new residents last year is 12045, regardless of the births. \nTherefore, the answer is (12045)\n\nQ: Last year, 87654 children were welcomed in a province, and 14567 individuals immigrated there.

If her team used a total of 698 chocolate chips today, how many chocolate chips did they use in the afternoon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many chocolate chips were used in the afternoon, we first need to recognize that all the chocolate chips used today total 698. Given that the problem states that the entire batch of 432 cookies was baked this morning, we need to clarify whether the cookies baked in the morning used a specific amount of chocolate chips or if all chips were used in making those cookies. Since it’s not specified that any were used after baking, we deduce that the total use (698) must be accounted for throughout the entire day, and since the cookies were baked in the morning, their portion must account for the use of chips in the morning batch. However, if the total number of chocolate chips used today is already known, without further context about the cookie baking processing pertaining to chips used in making the cookies, we conclude that there were no additional chips used in the afternoon post the baking count.

Once the crew began their work, a total of 850 liters had leaked by the time the repair was completed. To find out how much water leaked while the crew was working, we can subtract the initial 300 liters from the total of 850 liters. So, we calculate 850 liters - 300 liters = 550 liters. Thus, 550 liters of water leaked while the crew was actively working on the repairs.\nTherefore, the answer is (550)\n\nQ: An oil tanker ran aground during a storm. After the tanker was towed, 5000 gallons of oil were spilled into the ocean. There are 1000 gallons of oil still onboard. How many gallons did the oil tanker initially carry?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many gallons of oil the tanker initially carried, we need to add the amount of oil that was spilled to the amount that is still onboard. The tanker spilled 5000 gallons of oil into the ocean and still has 1000 gallons onboard. Therefore, the total amount of oil initially carried by the tanker is 5000 gallons (spilled) + 1000 gallons (still onboard) = 6000 gallons.\nTherefore, the answer is (6000)\n\nQ: A chemical tank in a factory started leaking. Before emergency responders could take action, 200 liters of toxic material leaked. Ultimately, 600 liters had escaped by the time the situation was under control. How many liters leaked while responders were on site?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, 200 liters of toxic material leaked before responders could take action. By the time the situation was under control, a total of 600 liters had escaped. To determine how many liters leaked while responders were on site, we subtract the initial 200 liters from the total 600 liters: 600 liters - 200 liters = 400 liters. This means that 400 liters leaked after the responders were on site and managed to control the situation. Therefore, the answer to how many liters leaked while responders were on site is 400 liters.\nTherefore, the answer is (400)\n\nQ: A coolant line in a power plant failed. Before the technicians could arrive, 400 gallons of coolant escaped. In total, 950 gallons were lost before the issue was resolved. How many gallons leaked while the technicians were working on it?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that 400 gallons of coolant had already escaped before technicians arrived. After that, a total of 950 gallons were lost before the issue was resolved. To find out how many gallons leaked while the technicians were working, we subtract the initial amount that leaked (400 gallons) from the total amount lost (950 gallons). This gives us the amount that leaked while technicians were on site: 950 gallons - 400 gallons = 550 gallons. Therefore, 550 gallons leaked while the technicians were working on it.\nTherefore, the answer is (550)\n\nQ: A fuel tank on a ship was damaged. Before the crew managed to contain it, 800 gallons of fuel leaked into the water. In total, 2000 gallons of fuel had leaked before the tank was secured. How many gallons leaked while the crew was addressing the issue?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe crew managed to contain the leak after 800 gallons had already leaked into the water. Since a total of 2000 gallons of fuel had leaked before the tank was secured, we calculate the amount that leaked while they were addressing the issue. The amount that leaked while they were addressing it is the total amount leaked minus the amount that had leaked before they managed to contain it: 2000 gallons - 800 gallons = 1200 gallons. Therefore, there were 1200 gallons that leaked while the crew was addressing the issue.\nTherefore, the answer is (1200)\n\nQ: A pipeline burst in the refinery. Before engineers could intervene, 3000 liters of crude oil leaked. While repairs were underway, another 2100 liters escaped. In total, what was the volume of crude oil that leaked?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find the total volume of crude oil that leaked during the incident. The initial burst resulted in a leak of 3000 liters. While repairs were being made, an additional 2100 liters leaked. To find the total leak, we simply add these two amounts together: 3000 liters + 2100 liters. Performing the addition gives us a total of 5100 liters. Therefore, we calculate the total volume of crude oil that leaked.\nTherefore, the answer is (5100)\n\nQ: An underground oil reservoir was punctured. Before repair teams noticed, 1000 barrels of oil released into the environment. In the end, 2500 barrels had leaked before repairs were completed. How many barrels of oil leaked during the fixing process?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, 1000 barrels of oil leaked before the repair teams noticed the puncture. During the repair process, it was found that an additional 1500 barrels leaked, bringing the total leakage to 2500 barrels. The question specifically asks how many barrels leaked during the fixing process. Given that the question implies the first 1000 barrels leaked before any repairs were started and does not account any further leaks while fixing, the conclusion must be that none leaked during the actual repairing of the puncture. Therefore, the fixing process itself did not contribute to any additional leakage.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQuestion: An oil pipe in the sea broke .

It is not specified how many cookies were made in the morning versus the afternoon, but we have a total of 432 cookies baked. For each cookie, we will assume a certain number of chocolate chips are used. However, if we do not know how many cookies were baked in the morning and afternoon separately, and we are only given a total use of chocolate chips, without any other context or information regarding distribution, we cannot accurately deduce how many chocolate chips were used specifically in the afternoon. Given that no chocolate chips were assigned specifically to morning or afternoon cookies, the answer remains undefined or zero.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: Jason had 28 cherries at his stall.

{'question': 'When Jake had 1 cat , he needed to serve 0.5 can of cat food each day . Now that Jake has adopted a second cat , he needs to serve a total of 0.9 can each day . How much extra food is needed to feed the second cat ? ', 'idx': 209, 'prompt': "Q: When Jessica had 1 ferret, she needed to serve 0.4 cup of ferret food each day. Now that Jessica has adopted a second ferret, she needs to serve a total of 0.6 cup each day. How much extra food is needed to feed the second ferret?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nJessica originally had 1 ferret and fed it 0.4 cup of food daily. After adopting a second ferret, she now feeds a total of 0.6 cup daily for both ferrets. To find out how much extra food is designated for the second ferret, we calculate the difference in daily food amount. The extra food provided for the new ferret can be found by subtracting the initial daily food (0.4 cup) from the new total (0.6 cup). Therefore, the extra food needed is 0.6 - 0.4 = 0.2 cup. Thus, there is an additional 0.2 cup of food required to accommodate the second ferret.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.2).)\n\nQ: When Tom had 3 rabbits, he needed to serve 0.6 kg of rabbit food each day. Now that Tom has adopted a fourth rabbit, he needs to serve a total of 1.0 kg each day. How much extra food is needed to feed the fourth rabbit?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTom originally had 3 rabbits and needed 0.6 kg of food for them. To find the amount of food needed per rabbit, we divide the total food by the number of rabbits: 0.6 kg / 3 rabbits = 0.2 kg per rabbit. Now, with the addition of a fourth rabbit, Tom serves a total of 1.0 kg of food each day. To find out how much food is needed for 4 rabbits, we divide 1.0 kg by 4: 1.0 kg / 4 rabbits = 0.25 kg per rabbit. The extra food needed for the fourth rabbit can be calculated by subtracting the previous amount of food per rabbit from the new amount: 0.25 kg - 0.2 kg = 0.05 kg. Thus, 0.05 kg of extra food is needed to feed the fourth rabbit.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.05).)\n\nQ: When Amy had 3 birds, she needed to serve 0.9 kg of bird seed each day. Now that Amy has adopted a fourth bird, she needs to serve a total of 1.5 kg each day. How much extra food is needed to feed the fourth bird?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Amy needed 0.9 kg of bird seed for 3 birds. To find out how much food was needed per bird, we divide the total amount of bird seed by the number of birds: 0.9 kg / 3 birds = 0.3 kg per bird. Now, with the addition of the fourth bird, Amy needs a total of 1.5 kg of bird seed per day. We again divide this total amount by the new number of birds: 1.5 kg / 4 birds = 0.375 kg per bird. Now, to find the extra food needed for the fourth bird, we subtract the previous amount of food per bird from the new amount: 0.375 kg - 0.3 kg = 0.075 kg. Therefore, the fourth bird needs an additional 0.075 kg of food compared to the average amount previously served.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.075).)\n\nQ: When Sarah had 1 turtle, she needed to serve 0.3 cup of turtle food each day. Now that Sarah has adopted a second turtle, she needs to serve a total of 0.5 cup each day. How much extra food is needed to feed the second turtle?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Sarah had 1 turtle and needed to serve 0.3 cup of food per day. After adopting a second turtle, she needs to serve a total of 0.5 cup of food per day. To find the extra food required for the second turtle, we can calculate the difference in the amount of food needed for one turtle and the total amount needed for two turtles. The food needed for the second turtle can be calculated as: Total food for 2 turtles (0.5 cup) - Food for 1 turtle (0.3 cup) = 0.5 cup - 0.3 cup = 0.2 cup. Therefore, the second turtle requires an additional 0.2 cup of food per day.\nTherefore, the answer is ((0.2))\n\nQ: When David had 3 fish, he needed to serve 0.5 cup of fish flakes each day. Now that David has adopted a fourth fish, he needs to serve a total of 0.8 cup each day. How much extra food is needed to feed the fourth fish?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nDavid initially had 3 fish and fed them 0.5 cup of fish flakes each day. This means he was feeding each fish 0.5 / 3 = 0.1667 cups of food per fish. After adopting a fourth fish, his total food amount increased to 0.8 cups per day. Now with 4 fish, each fish is getting 0.8 / 4 = 0.2 cups of food per fish. The difference in food per fish before and after adding the fourth fish is 0.2 - 0.1667 = 0.0333 cups. Therefore, the extra food needed to feed the fourth fish each day is not just for that one fish, but the total amount needed increased only because of the added fish. Since the previous total was 0.5 cups for 3 fish, and they now share 0.8 cups for 4 fish, the increase in overall food was simply a reallocation, and in short, no extra food is needed beyond what’s allocated for the fourth fish. Therefore, the actual answer to the question is that no extra food is needed in addition to the current total serving.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: Mark has 3 cats. Each day, one cat eats 0.2 scoop of cat food, and the other two cats eat 0.1 scoop and 0.15 scoop respectively. Together, how much cat food do the 3 cats eat each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total amount of cat food consumed by the three cats each day, we need to add the amount of food each cat eats. The first cat eats 0.2 scoop, the second cat eats 0.1 scoop, and the third cat eats 0.15 scoop. We can calculate the total as follows: \\n\\nTotal food = 0.2 + 0.1 + 0.15 = 0.45. \\n\\nTherefore, the total amount of cat food that the 3 cats eat together each day is 0.45 scoop.\nTherefore, the answer is ((0.45))\n\nQ: When Lisa had 2 dogs, she needed to serve 1.2 kg of dog food each day. Now that Lisa has adopted a third dog, she needs to serve a total of 1.8 kg each day. How much extra food is needed to feed the third dog?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLisa originally had 2 dogs and served them a total of 1.2 kg of dog food each day. This means that before adopting the third dog, each dog was getting 1.2 kg / 2 = 0.6 kg of food per day. After adopting the third dog, the total food required increased to 1.8 kg per day. Now, with 3 dogs, each dog is getting 1.8 kg / 3 = 0.6 kg of food per day, which is the same amount each dog received before. Since the total food amount (1.8 kg) equals the sum of the individual amounts (0.6 kg each for 3 dogs), there is no extra food needed specifically for the third dog as the total per dog remains consistent.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: When Mark had 2 hamsters, he needed to serve 0.4 cup of hamster food each day. Now that Mark has adopted a third hamster, he needs to serve a total of 0.7 cup each day. How much extra food is needed to feed the third hamster?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMark originally had 2 hamsters and needed to serve 0.4 cups of food daily. This means each hamster was receiving 0.4 cups / 2 hamsters = 0.2 cups of food per hamster per day. After adopting a third hamster, the total food requirement increased to 0.7 cups daily. Now with 3 hamsters, the food per hamster is 0.7 cups / 3 hamsters = approximately 0.2333 cups per hamster per day. To determine the extra food needed for the third hamster, we compare the new food requirement per hamster (0.2333 cups) to the old requirement (0.2 cups). The difference is approximately 0.2333 cups - 0.2 cups = 0.0333 cups. Thus, the third hamster requires an additional 0.0333 cups of food each day compared to what the first two received prior. However, since the total food requirement has increased from 0.4 cups to 0.7 cups, it indicates that the total amount needed for all hamsters has increased, not solely indicating a need for more per individual hamster. Therefore, technically, the amount of extra food is attributed to the total increase.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (0.0333).)\n\nQuestion: When Jake had 1 cat , he needed to serve 0.5 can of cat food each day .

This morning, her team baked 432 cookies using chocolate chips. If her team used a total of 698 chocolate chips today, how many chocolate chips did they use in the afternoon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many chocolate chips were used in the afternoon, we first need to determine if the chocolate chips used are directly related to the number of cookies baked. It appears that the total number of cookies baked in the morning was 432, and the total number of chocolate chips used today was 698. Since the problem only states that cookies were baked in the morning (with no mention of additional cookies baked in the afternoon or different batches), we can conclude that the workshop did not deploy more chocolate chips in the afternoon. Hence, the cookies baked this morning used some of the chocolate chips, leaving a remaining amount for the afternoon that may not correlate directly with a specific number of cookies unless explicitly mentioned in the problem description. As there is no data to suggest more chocolate chips were used after the morning batch, we assume that no additional chips were needed for the afternoon. Therefore, it can be said that the quantity of chocolate chips used in the afternoon is zero.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: Sophie summed up the leftover cookies after a bake sale.

Now that David has adopted a fourth fish, he needs to serve a total of 0.8 cup each day. How much extra food is needed to feed the fourth fish?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, David served 0.5 cups of fish flakes for 3 fish, meaning he served 0.5 / 3 = 0.1667 cups per fish each day. After adopting the fourth fish, he needs to serve a total of 0.8 cups for 4 fish, which means he now serves 0.8 / 4 = 0.2 cups per fish each day. The increase in food needed per fish is 0.2 - 0.1667 = 0.0333 cups per fish.

{'question': 'There were a total of 8 football games this year , 4 are played at night . Keith missed 4 of the games . How many football games did Keith go to in total ? ', 'idx': 299, 'prompt': "Q: Michael's baseball team played 20 games this season. The team secured victory in more than half of their matches. They faced defeat in 8 games. How many games did they win?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe baseball team played a total of 20 games. If they secured victory in more than half of their matches, that means they won at least 11 games (since half of 20 is 10). They faced defeat in 8 games. To find out how many games they won, we subtract the number of games they lost from the total games played. Total games (20) - Lost games (8) = Won games (20 - 8 = 12).

The team achieved victories in more than half of their games. They faced setbacks in 9 games. How many games did they win?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the number of games Ava's lacrosse team won, we start with the total number of games played, which is 22. They faced setbacks in 9 games, meaning they lost those games. To calculate the number of wins, we first determine how many games were not lost. This is done by subtracting the number of lost games from the total games: 22 - 9 = 13. Since the team achieved victories in more than half of their games, we now find half of the total games, which is 22 / 2 = 11. Consequently, winning more than half means they must have won at least 12 games. However, since they can only win up to 13 games, the possible number of wins is either 12 or 13.

How many rabbits did he have to start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet's denote the number of rabbits Mike initially had as X. After the baby rabbits were born, he had X + 3 rabbits. Mike then gave away a total of 7 rabbits (5 to his cousin and 2 to a shelter), leaving him with X + 3 - 7 rabbits. We know that after these actions, he has 6 rabbits left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: X + 3 - 7 = 6. Simplifying this gives us X - 4 = 6, which leads us to X = 10. Therefore, the number of rabbits Mike had to start with is 10, before the babies were born.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Tom's rabbit had a few babies. He sold 5 of them. At the moment, he has 3 baby rabbits. How many baby rabbits did he have to begin with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTom sold 5 baby rabbits and currently has 3 baby rabbits. To find out how many he had initially, we need to add the number of rabbits he sold to the number of rabbits he currently has.

Together, how much cat food do the 3 cats eat each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total amount of cat food that Mark's 3 cats eat each day, we need to add the amount of food each cat eats. The first cat eats 0.2 scoops, the second cat eats 0.1 scoops, and the third cat eats 0.15 scoops. So, we calculate the total: 0.2 + 0.1 + 0.15 = 0.45 scoops. Therefore, the total amount of cat food eaten by all three cats each day is 0.45 scoops.\nTherefore, the answer is ((0.45))\n\nQ: Ella's hamster had pups and 3 were gray. She gave 9 to her classmates and 1 to her neighbor. She now has 2 hamsters. How many hamsters did she have to start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nElla had some hamsters. After her hamster had pups, we know that some of these pups (3) were gray. She gave away a total of 9 pups to classmates and 1 to her neighbor, totaling 10 pups given away. If Ella now has 2 hamsters remaining after giving away 10, we can deduce that initially, she must have started with 12 hamsters (2 + 10 = 12). Therefore, she had 12 hamsters to begin with, which includes the pups and the original hamster. \nTherefore, the answer is (12)\n\nQ: Mike's cat had 10 kittens and 6 were black. He gave 5 to a shelter. How many kittens does he now have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMike originally had 10 kittens. He gave 5 kittens to a shelter.

After reviewing them, they found that 9 were broken. How many toys did they find altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine the total number of toys discovered by Oliver and Sophia. Oliver found 14 toys and Sophia found 26 toys. Therefore, we add these two numbers together: 14 + 26 = 40. Next, we note that the number of broken toys does not affect the total count of toys discovered; it only informs us about their condition. Thus, the total number of toys they found altogether is 40. \nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: Mark discovered 3 pencils on his desk and lined them up. One pencil was 6 inches long. The other was 4 inches long. How much longer was the longer pencil?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe have two pencils with lengths of 6 inches and 4 inches. To determine how much longer the longer pencil (6 inches) is than the shorter pencil (4 inches), we need to subtract the length of the shorter pencil from the length of the longer pencil. This can be calculated as follows: 6 inches - 4 inches = 2 inches. Therefore, the longer pencil is 2 inches longer than the shorter pencil.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQ: There are 4 toys in the cabinet and 9 toys on the carpet. Sarah brought 6 toys and 2 puzzles onto the carpet. How many toys are there now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there are 4 toys in the cabinet and 9 toys on the carpet. This means the total number of toys before Sarah brought any is 4 + 9 = 13 toys. Sarah then brought 6 additional toys to the carpet. So, we add those 6 toys to the existing 13 toys, resulting in 13 + 6 = 19 toys. There are also 2 puzzles, but since the question asks for toys, we do not count puzzles. Therefore, the total number of toys now is 19.\nTherefore, the answer is (19)\n\nQ: Ella's hamster had pups and 3 were gray. She gave 9 to her classmates and 1 to her neighbor. She now has 2 hamsters. How many hamsters did she have to start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nElla's hamster had pups, and we know she now has 2 hamsters. She gave away 9 hamsters to her classmates and 1 to her neighbor. This means she gave away a total of 10 hamsters. If we denote the number of hamsters she started with as X, we can establish the equation: X - 10 + Y = 2, where Y corresponds to the number of pups she had. Since she had 3 gray pups, let's assume these pups are part of Y. Therefore, before giving any away, she had X hamsters, and after giving 10 away, she has Y remaining plus the original hamster, equating to 2. Therefore, we can infer that X must have been 12, accounting for the 10 given away and the 2 that remained. However, if she had one original hamster, she did not start with any beyond that, meaning the calculation shows she started with 1 and then had the 11 remaining pups. Thus considering all factors, she began with just 1 hamster originally. \nTherefore, the answer is (1)\n\nQ: Lily had crayons. She gave 4 to her brother. She now has 6 crayons. How many crayons did she have to start with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of crayons Lily had to start with be represented as x. She gave 4 crayons to her brother. After giving away 4 crayons, the number of crayons she has left is x - 4. We are told that this amount equals 6 crayons. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 4 = 6. To find x, we will add 4 to both sides of the equation: x - 4 + 4 = 6 + 4 gives us x = 10. Therefore, Lily had 10 crayons to start with.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQuestion: There are 7 crayons in the drawer and 6 crayons on the desk .
