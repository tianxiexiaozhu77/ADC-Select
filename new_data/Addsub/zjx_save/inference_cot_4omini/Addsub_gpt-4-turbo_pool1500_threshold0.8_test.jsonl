', 'idx': 0, 'prompt': "Q: Natalie harvested 100 oranges from her garden. She gave some of her oranges to her neighbor. Now she has 45 oranges left. How many oranges did she give away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nNatalie originally had 100 oranges. After giving some away, she was left with 45 oranges. To find out how many oranges she gave away, we subtract the number of oranges she has left from the original amount. This means we calculate 100 - 45. The result of this calculation will give us the number of oranges she gave away.\nTherefore, the answer is (55)\n\nQ: Liam baked 50 cookies for the party. He shared some of his cookies with Emma. Now he has 22 cookies left. How many cookies did he give to Emma?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLiam originally baked 50 cookies. After sharing some with Emma, he has 22 cookies remaining. To determine the number of cookies Liam gave to Emma, we subtract the number of cookies he has left from the original number of cookies he baked. This can be expressed as: Number of cookies given to Emma = Original number of cookies - Cookies left. Thus, we calculate it as follows: 50 - 22 = 28. Therefore, Liam gave 28 cookies to Emma.\nTherefore, the answer is (28)\n\nQ: Tom built 75 toy models. He gifted some of his models to his cousin. Now he has 32 models left.

How many pages did she share?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nClaire started with 120 pages in her notebook. She now has 58 pages left. To find out how many pages she shared, we need to calculate the difference between the original number of pages and the number she has remaining. We can do this using the equation: pages shared = original pages - remaining pages. Substituting the known values: pages shared = 120 - 58.\nTherefore, the answer is (62)\n\nQ: Josh captured 60 photos during his vacation. He shared some of his photos with his brother.

We can find out how many photos he shared by subtracting the number of photos he has now from the number of photos he originally captured. This calculation is: 60 - 28 = 32. Thus, he shared 32 photos with his brother.\nTherefore, the answer is (32)\n\nQ: Emily collected 85 stamps from various countries. She donated some of her stamps to a local charity. Currently, she has 35 stamps remaining. How many stamps did she donate?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many stamps Emily donated, we start with the total number of stamps she initially collected, which is 85. After donating some of her stamps, she has 35 stamps remaining. To find the number of stamps she donated, we subtract the number of stamps she has left from the total number of stamps she collected: 85 - 35 = 50. Therefore, Emily donated 50 stamps.\nTherefore, the answer is (50)\n\nQ: Sophia picked 90 apples from the orchard. She sold some of her apples at the market. Now she has 40 apples left. How many apples did she sell?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSophia began with 90 apples. After selling some, she is left with 40 apples. To find out how many apples she sold, we can subtract the number of apples she has left from the number she originally picked. Therefore, we do the calculation: 90 - 40 = 50. This means she sold 50 apples.\nTherefore, the answer is (50)\n\nQ: Michael found 42 rocks in the river. He gave some of his rocks to his friend Alex. He now has 15 rocks left. How many rocks did he give to Alex?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMichael initially found 42 rocks. After giving some of his rocks to Alex, he has 15 rocks left. To find out how many rocks he gave away, we can set up the equation: Initial rocks - Rocks given to Alex = Remaining rocks. This can be written as: 42 - x = 15, where x is the number of rocks given to Alex. To find x, we rearrange the equation: x = 42 - 15. Now we calculate: 42 - 15 = 27. Thus, Michael gave 27 rocks to Alex.\nTherefore, the answer is (27)\n\nQuestion: Joan found 70 seashells on the beach . she gave Sam some of her seashells . She has 27 seashell .

There are now 50 chairs in the hall. How many chairs did she bring?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 25 chairs in the hall. Rachel brought more chairs to the hall, leading to a total of 50 chairs. To find out how many chairs Rachel brought, we subtract the initial number of chairs from the final total. This can be calculated as follows: 50 (total chairs) - 25 (initial chairs) = 25. Therefore, Rachel brought 25 chairs.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: Sophia picked 90 apples from the orchard.

Melissa put more bottles in the cooler today. There are now 45 bottles of water in the cooler. How many bottles did she add?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nAt the beginning, there were 20 bottles of water in the cooler. After Melissa added some bottles, the total increased to 45 bottles. To find out how many bottles Melissa added, we can set up the following equation: total bottles after Melissa added = initial bottles + bottles added. Plugging in the numbers we have: 45 = 20 + bottles added. To find the number of bottles added, we can rearrange this to get bottles added = total bottles after Melissa added - initial bottles. Therefore, bottles added = 45 - 20, which equals 25. Hence, Melissa added 25 bottles of water to the cooler.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: Originally, there were 60 books on the shelf.
