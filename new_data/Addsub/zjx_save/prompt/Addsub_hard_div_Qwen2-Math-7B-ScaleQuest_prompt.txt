Q: On her vacation last summer , Trisha walked all over New York City to buy souvenirs . First , she walked 0.1111111111111111 mile from her hotel to a postcard shop . Then she walked 0.1111111111111111 mile from the postcard shop to a T-shirt shop and 0.6666666666666666 mile from the T-shirt shop back to the hotel . How many miles did Trisha walk in all ? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To determine the total distance Trisha walked, we need to add the distances of each segment of her walk. The distances are given as follows:

1. From the hotel to the postcard shop: 0.1111111111111111 miles
2. From the postcard shop to the T-shirt shop: 0.1111111111111111 miles
3. From the T-shirt shop back to the hotel: 0.6666666666666666 miles

First, let's add the first two distances:
\[ 0.1111111111111111 + 0.1111111111111111 = 0.2222222222222222 \]

Next, we add this result to the third distance:
\[ 0.2222222222222222 + 0.6666666666666666 = 0.8888888888888888 \]

Therefore, the total distance Trisha walked is:
\[ \boxed{0.8888888888888888} \]

To express this in a more simplified form, we can recognize that \(0.8888888888888888\) is a repeating decimal, which can be written as \(0.\overline{8}\). However, the problem asks for the answer in decimal form, so the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{0.8888888888888888} \]
The total distance Trisha walked is \(\boxed{0.8888888888888888}\) miles.


Q: Before starting her shift , a waitress checks to make sure there is enough mustard for her customers . She finds 0.25 bottle at the first table , 0.25 bottle at the second table , and 0.375 bottle at the third table . Altogether , how many bottles of mustard does the waitress find ? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To determine the total number of bottles of mustard the waitress finds, we need to add the amounts of mustard from each table. The amounts are 0.25 bottles, 0.25 bottles, and 0.375 bottles.

First, let's add the amounts from the first two tables:
\[0.25 + 0.25 = 0.50\]

Next, we add the amount from the third table to the result from the first two tables:
\[0.50 + 0.375 = 0.875\]

Therefore, the total number of bottles of mustard the waitress finds is:
\[
\boxed{0.875}

Q: Benny received 79 dollars and 9 movie tickets for his birthday . He went to a sporting goods store and bought a baseball glove , baseball , and bat . He had 32 dollars over , how much did he spent on the baseball gear ? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To determine how much Benny spent on the baseball gear, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Benny had initially.
2. Determine how much money Benny had after buying the baseball gear.
3. Subtract the amount of money Benny had after buying the baseball gear from the total amount of money he initially had to find out how much he spent on the baseball gear.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Benny had initially.
Benny received 79 dollars and 9 movie tickets. However, the cost of the movie tickets is not given, so we assume that the only money he had initially is the 79 dollars. Therefore, the total amount of money Benny had initially is 79 dollars.

Step 2: Determine how much money Benny had after buying the baseball gear.
We know that after buying the baseball gear, Benny had 32 dollars left over. This means that the amount of money he had after buying the baseball gear is the initial amount of money he had minus the amount he spent on the baseball gear.

Step 3: Subtract the amount of money Benny had after buying the baseball gear from the total amount of money he initially had to find out how much he spent on the baseball gear.
Let's denote the amount of money Benny spent on the baseball gear as \( x \). According to the problem, after spending \( x \) dollars, Benny had 32 dollars left. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 79 - x = 32 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 79 - 32 \]
\[ x = 47 \]

So, Benny spent 47 dollars on the baseball gear.
The answer is \(\boxed{47}\).]}...........


Q: While taking inventory at her pastry shop , Kelly realizes that she had 0.4 box of baking powder yesterday , but the supply is now down to 0.3 box . How much more baking powder did Kelly have yesterday ? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To determine how much more baking powder Kelly had yesterday compared to today, we need to subtract the current amount of baking powder from the amount she had yesterday. Here are the steps:

1. Identify the amount of baking powder Kelly had yesterday: 0.4 box.
2. Identify the current amount of baking powder Kelly has: 0.3 box.
3. Subtract the current amount from the amount she had yesterday:
   \[
   0.4 \text{ box} - 0.3 \text{ box} = 0.1 \text{ box}
   \]

So, Kelly had 0.1 box more baking powder yesterday than she does today. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{0.1}
\].


Q: Irwin 's family went on a camping trip in the mountains . On the first day , they hiked from their car to the campsite . First , they hiked 0.2 mile from the car to a stream , and 0.4 mile from the stream to a meadow . Then they hiked 0.1 mile from the meadow to the campsite . How many miles did Irwin 's family hike in all ? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To determine the total distance Irwin's family hiked, we need to add the distances of each segment of their hike. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first segment of the hike was from the car to the stream, which was 0.2 miles.
2. The second segment of the hike was from the stream to the meadow, which was 0.4 miles.
3. The third segment of the hike was from the meadow to the campsite, which was 0.1 miles.

Now, we add these distances together:

\[ 0.2 \text{ miles} + 0.4 \text{ miles} + 0.1 \text{ miles} \]

First, add 0.2 and 0.4:

\[ 0.2 + 0.4 = 0.6 \]

Next, add the result to 0.1:

\[ 0.6 + 0.1 = 0.7 \]
Therefore, the total distance Irwin's family hiked is \(\boxed{0.7}\) miles.


Q: Last Saturday , Spencer walked all over town running errands . First , he walked 0.3 mile from his house to the library and 0.1 mile from the library to the post office . Then he walked 0.4 mile from the post office back home . How many miles did Spencer walk in all ? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To determine the total distance Spencer walked, we need to add up the distances of each segment of his walk. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Distance from Spencer's house to the library:**
   \[
   0.3 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance from the library to the post office:**
   \[
   0.1 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Distance from the post office back home:**
   \[
   0.4 \text{ miles}
   \]

Next, we add these distances together:
\[
0.3 + 0.1 + 0.4
\]

First, add the distances from the house to the library and from the library to the post office:
\[
0.3 + 0.1 = 0.4 \text{ miles}
\]

Then, add the distance from the post office back home:
\[
0.4 + 0.4 = 0.8 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the total distance Spencer walked is:
\[
\boxed{0.8}
\]
So, Spencer walked a total of \(\boxed{0.8}\) miles.


Q: Joan joined her school 's band . She bought a trumpet for $ 149.16 , a music tool for $ 9.98 , and a song book which was $ 4.14 . Joan found $ 8.65 in her pocket . How much did Joan spend at the music store ? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To determine how much Joan spent at the music store, we need to add the cost of the trumpet, the music tool, and the song book. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify the cost of each item:
   - Trumpet: $149.16
   - Music tool: $9.98
   - Song book: $4.14

2. Add the costs together:
   \[
   149.16 + 9.98 + 4.14
   \]

3. First, add the cost of the trumpet and the music tool:
   \[
   149.16 + 9.98 = 159.14
   \]

4. Next, add the cost of the song book to the result from the previous step:
   \[
   159.14 + 4.14 = 163.28
   \]
So, Joan spent a total of $163.28 at the music store. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{163.28}
\].


Q: Hoping to be named Salesperson of the Month , Rosa called the names from 10.2 pages of the phone book last week . This week , she called the people listed on another 8.6 pages of the same phone book . How many pages worth of people did Rosa call in all ? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To determine the total number of pages worth of people that Rosa called, we need to add the number of pages she called last week to the number of pages she called this week. The number of pages she called last week is 10.2, and the number of pages she called this week is 8.6. We can express this as:

\[ 10.2 + 8.6 \]

To add these two numbers, we can align the decimal points and add the numbers as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{r}
  10.2 \\
+  8.6 \\
\hline
  18.8 \\
\end{array}
\]

So, the total number of pages worth of people that Rosa called is:

\[ \boxed{18.8} \]
Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{18.8}\).
