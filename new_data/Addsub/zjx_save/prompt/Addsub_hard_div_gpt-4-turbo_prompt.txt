Q: On her vacation last summer , Trisha walked all over New York City to buy souvenirs . First , she walked 0.1111111111111111 mile from her hotel to a postcard shop . Then she walked 0.1111111111111111 mile from the postcard shop to a T-shirt shop and 0.6666666666666666 mile from the T-shirt shop back to the hotel . How many miles did Trisha walk in all ? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To find out how many miles Trisha walked in total, we need to add up the distances she walked during each segment of her trip. First, she walked 0.1111111111111111 mile from her hotel to the postcard shop. Then, she walked another 0.1111111111111111 mile from the postcard shop to the T-shirt shop. Finally, she walked 0.6666666666666666 mile from the T-shirt shop back to the hotel. Adding these three distances together gives us the total distance walked: 0.1111111111111111 + 0.1111111111111111 + 0.6666666666666666 = 0.8888888888888888 miles.
Therefore, the answer is (0.8888888888888888).


Q: Before starting her shift , a waitress checks to make sure there is enough mustard for her customers . She finds 0.25 bottle at the first table , 0.25 bottle at the second table , and 0.375 bottle at the third table . Altogether , how many bottles of mustard does the waitress find ? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To find the total amount of mustard bottles, we need to add the quantities from each table. The first table has 0.25 of a bottle, the second table also has 0.25 of a bottle, and the third table has 0.375 of a bottle. To get the total, we add these amounts together: 0.25 (from the first table) + 0.25 (from the second table) + 0.375 (from the third table) = 0.875. Therefore, the waitress finds a total of 0.875 bottles of mustard.
Therefore, the answer is (0.875).


Q: Benny received 79 dollars and 9 movie tickets for his birthday . He went to a sporting goods store and bought a baseball glove , baseball , and bat . He had 32 dollars over , how much did he spent on the baseball gear ? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
Benny initially received 79 dollars. After purchasing the baseball gear (glove, baseball, and bat), he had 32 dollars left. To find out how much Benny spent on the baseball gear, we subtract the amount he had left from the amount he initially received. Calculation: 79 dollars (initial amount) - 32 dollars (amount left) = 47 dollars. Therefore, Benny spent 47 dollars on the baseball gear.
Therefore, the answer is (47).


Q: While taking inventory at her pastry shop , Kelly realizes that she had 0.4 box of baking powder yesterday , but the supply is now down to 0.3 box . How much more baking powder did Kelly have yesterday ? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To find out how much more baking powder Kelly had yesterday compared to today, we need to subtract the amount she has today from the amount she had yesterday. Yesterday, Kelly had 0.4 box of baking powder, and today she has 0.3 box. The subtraction for this calculation is 0.4 - 0.3. This gives us 0.1, which represents the difference in the amount of baking powder between yesterday and today.
Therefore, the answer is (0.1).


Q: Irwin 's family went on a camping trip in the mountains . On the first day , they hiked from their car to the campsite . First , they hiked 0.2 mile from the car to a stream , and 0.4 mile from the stream to a meadow . Then they hiked 0.1 mile from the meadow to the campsite . How many miles did Irwin 's family hike in all ? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To calculate the total distance Irwin's family hiked, we need to add up the distances of each segment of their hike. First, they hiked 0.2 miles from the car to a stream. Then, they hiked 0.4 miles from the stream to a meadow. Finally, they hiked 0.1 mile from the meadow to the campsite. By adding these distances together, we get the total hiking distance: 0.2 miles + 0.4 miles + 0.1 miles = 0.7 miles.
Therefore, the answer is (0.7).


Q: Last Saturday , Spencer walked all over town running errands . First , he walked 0.3 mile from his house to the library and 0.1 mile from the library to the post office . Then he walked 0.4 mile from the post office back home . How many miles did Spencer walk in all ? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To find the total distance Spencer walked, we need to add up the distances for each segment of his trip. First, he walked 0.3 mile from his house to the library. Next, he walked 0.1 mile from the library to the post office. Finally, he walked 0.4 mile from the post office back to his house. Adding these distances together gives us the total distance walked. Calculation: 0.3 mile + 0.1 mile + 0.4 mile = 0.8 mile.
Therefore, the answer is (0.8).


Q: Joan joined her school 's band . She bought a trumpet for $ 149.16 , a music tool for $ 9.98 , and a song book which was $ 4.14 . Joan found $ 8.65 in her pocket . How much did Joan spend at the music store ? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To find out how much Joan spent at the music store, we need to add up the cost of all the items she bought. She bought a trumpet for $149.16, a music tool for $9.98, and a song book for $4.14. First, we add the cost of the trumpet and the music tool: $149.16 + $9.98 = $159.14. Next, we add the cost of the song book: $159.14 + $4.14 = $163.28. The amount Joan found in her pocket ($8.65) is not relevant to the total amount she spent at the store, so we ignore it for this calculation. Therefore, the total amount Joan spent at the music store is $163.28.
Therefore, the answer is (163.28).


Q: Hoping to be named Salesperson of the Month , Rosa called the names from 10.2 pages of the phone book last week . This week , she called the people listed on another 8.6 pages of the same phone book . How many pages worth of people did Rosa call in all ? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To find out how many pages worth of people Rosa called in total, we need to add the number of pages she called from last week and this week. Last week, she called names from 10.2 pages, and this week, she called names from 8.6 pages. By adding these two numbers, we calculate the total number of pages: 10.2 pages + 8.6 pages = 18.8 pages.
Therefore, the answer is (18.8).
