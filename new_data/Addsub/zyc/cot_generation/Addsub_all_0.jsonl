{"question": "There are 35 cedar trees and 22 fir trees currently in the botanical garden. Gardeners had to cut down 5 cedar trees that were weak. How many cedar trees will be in the botanical garden when the gardeners are finished?", "cot": "To find the number of cedar trees remaining in the botanical garden after cutting down weak trees, we start with the initial count of cedar trees, which is 35. Since the gardeners cut down 5 cedar trees, we need to subtract this number from the initial count. Therefore, we calculate: 35 - 5 = 30. Thus, there will be 30 cedar trees left in the botanical garden after the removal of the weak trees.", "answer": "Therefore, the answer is (30).", "score": 5.313984953379081}
