To find the total number of pages worth of people she called, we add the two amounts together: 10.2 + 8.6 = 18.8.\nTherefore, the answer is (18.8)\n\nQuestion: 0.5 the students in the band are in the trumpet section . 0.125 the students in the band are in the trombone section . What fraction of the students in the band are in either the trumpet section or the trombone section ? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "To find the fraction of students in either the trumpet section or the trombone section of the band, let's break it down step by step:\\n\\n1. **Fraction in the trumpet section**: 0.5 of the students are in the trumpet section.\\n2. **Fraction in the trombone section**: 0.125 of the students are in the trombone section.\\n\\nWe need to find the fraction of students in either section, which involves adding these two fractions together. However, since some students might be counted in both sections (if they play both trumpet and trombone), we must ensure not to double-count those students.\\n\\nTo find the total fraction:\\n- **Total fraction in both sections**: 0.5 (trumpet) + 0.125 (trombone)\\n\\nNow, we need to check if any students are counted in both sections. If no students are in both sections (assuming exclusive membership), then the total fraction would simply be the sum of the two individual fractions:\\n\\n\\[ 0.5 + 0.125 = 0.625 \\]\\n\\nTherefore, **0.625** (or \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\)) of the students in the band are in either the trumpet section or the trombone section.\\n\\nIf some students are in both sections (which is not specified in the problem), the actual fraction would be slightly less than 0.625, accounting for the overlap. But based on the given information and typical interpretations of such problems, we proceed with the straightforward addition of fractions.\\n\\nSo, the answer is **0.625** or \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\).", 'true_answer': ['0.625']}
