He found a dollar bill, which means he has an additional $1.00 to spend. To find the total cost of Keith's purchases, we add up all the expenses: 6.51 + 5.79 + 12.51 = 24.81. Then we add the extra dollar he found: 24.81 + 1 = 25.81\nTherefore, the answer is (24.81)\n\nQ: Mary went to the mall . She spent $ 13.04 on a shirt and $ 12.27 on a jacket . She went to 2 shops .

He went to a sporting goods store and bought a baseball glove , baseball , and bat . He had 32 dollars over , how much did he spent on the baseball gear ? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we add the value of the movie tickets to the amount of money Benny received: 79 dollars + 9 tickets = 79 dollars + 9 x 10 dollars (assuming each ticket is worth 10 dollars) = 79 + 90 = 169 dollars. Then, we subtract the cost of the baseball gear from the total amount he had left: 169 - 32 = 137. So, he spent a total of 137 dollars on the baseball gear.

Since the result is negative, we cannot use the value of the movie tickets to calculate how much Benny spent on baseball gear. Therefore, we only consider the $79 that he received for his birthday.

We do this by subtracting the 32 dollars he had left over from the 79 dollars he received for his birthday. This gives us 79 - 32 = 47 dollars. Then, we need to account for the value of the movie tickets, which are not applicable to buying baseball gear. So, we subtract the value of the movie tickets from the amount of money Benny had before going to the store. If each movie ticket is worth $10, then 9 tickets would be worth 9 * 10 = 90 dollars. Therefore, we have 47 - 90 = -43 dollars.

He went to a sporting goods store and bought a baseball glove , baseball , and bat . He had 32 dollars over , how much did he spent on the baseball gear ? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nBenny received 79 dollars and 9 movie tickets for his birthday, so the total value of the gifts is 79 + 9x = 79 + 0 = 79. Benny went to a sporting goods store and bought a baseball glove, baseball, and bat. Let's say he spent x dollars on the baseball gear. So, the total amount spent is x + x + x = 3x. It is given that he had 32 dollars left over after buying the baseball gear, so we can set up the equation: 79 - (3x) = 32. Solving for x gives us: x = (79 - 32) / 3 = 47 / 3 = 15.666... Since Benny cannot spend a fraction of a dollar, we round down to $15.
