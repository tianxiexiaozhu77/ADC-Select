How many walnut trees will be in the park when the workers are finished ? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we start with the total number of walnut trees in the park which is 42. Then we subtract the 13 damaged walnut trees that were cut down by the workers. 42 - 13 = 29. Therefore, there will be 29 walnut trees in the park when the workers are finished.\nTherefore, the answer is (29)\n\n\nQ: There are 6 short bushes and 4 tall trees currently in the park . Park workers had to cut down 2 short bushes that were damaged .

Park workers will plant 5 dogwood trees today and 4 dogwood trees tomorrow . It took 8 workers to finish the work . How many dogwood trees will the park have when the workers are finished ? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, there are 7 dogwood trees in the park. Today, 5 more will be planted, bringing the total to 7 + 5 = 12. Tomorrow, 4 more will be planted, bringing the total to 12 + 4 = 16. Therefore, the park will have 16 dogwood trees when the workers are finished.\nTherefore, the answer is (16)\n\n\nQ: There are 47 orchid bushes currently in the park . Park workers will plant 37 orchid bushes today and 25 orchid bushes tomorrow . It took 35 workers to finish the work . How many orchid bushes will the park have when the workers are finished ? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we add the number of orchid bushes to be planted today and tomorrow: 47 + 37 + 25 = 109. Then, we know that it took 35 workers to finish the work, so the total number of orchid bushes when the workers are finished is 109.\nTherefore, the answer is (109)\n\n\nQ: There are 43 maple trees and 22 orange trees currently in the park . Park workers will plant maple trees today . When the workers are finished there will be 54 maple trees in the park . How many maple trees did the workers plant today ? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we subtract the current number of maple trees from the final number to find out how many will be planted: 54 - 43 = 11. Therefore, the workers will plant 11 maple trees today.\nTherefore, the answer is (11)\n\n\nQ: There are 31 short trees and 32 tall trees currently in the park . Park workers will plant short trees today . When the workers are finished there will be 95 short trees in the park . How many short trees did the workers plant today ? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we subtract the current number of short trees (31) from the desired number of short trees (95) to find out how many more short trees are needed. 95 - 31 = 64. Therefore, the workers need to plant 64 short trees today.\nTherefore, the answer is (64)\n\n\nQ: There are 5 oak trees currently in the park . Park workers will plant 4 oak trees today . How many oak trees will the park have when the workers are finished ? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nCurrently there are 5 oak trees in the park. Workers will plant 4 more oak trees today, so we need to add these to the current number of trees. 5 (current trees) + 4 (newly planted trees) = 9 total oak trees.\nTherefore, the answer is (9)\n\n\n"}
