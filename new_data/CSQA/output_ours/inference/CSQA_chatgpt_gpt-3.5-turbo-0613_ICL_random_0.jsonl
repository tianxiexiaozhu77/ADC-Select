When someone applies for a job, they might indeed experience a range of emotions. "Horror" might be a bit extreme, though some people might feel that way if they\'re particularly nervous. "Anxiety and fear" seem more fitting, as it\'s common for people to feel nervous or anxious about the outcome of their application. "Rejection" is another possibility, especially if they\'ve faced rejection before or are worried about not being chosen. "Increased workload" doesn\'t typically come into play until after someone has been hired.

However, they might struggle with hoarding or maintaining relationships if their greed affects their behavior.\\n\\n(B) Make friends: Greed can indeed hinder someone's ability to make friends because it often involves selfishness and a lack of consideration for others' needs and feelings. People may be wary of forming close relationships with someone who is excessively greedy.\\n\\n(C) Play poker: Greed might actually drive someone to play poker, as they may be seeking to win more money or possessions. However, excessive greed could lead to reckless behavior and poor decision-making at the poker table.\\n\\n(D) Conquer opponent: Greed could potentially drive someone to try to conquer opponents in various contexts, such as in business or competition. However, if their greed clouds their judgment or makes them overly aggressive, it could actually hinder their ability to conquer opponents effectively.\\n\\n(E) Lie: Greed might lead someone to lie in order to obtain more wealth, possessions, or advantages. However, lying is not solely driven by greed, and people may lie for various reasons unrelated to greed.\\n\\nConsidering these options, (B) Make friends seems to be the most directly affected by excessive greed.

Most companies would not want this because it can lead to excess inventory and potential losses.\\n\\n(B) plentitude: This suggests an abundance or plenty of something. While having a lot of demand is generally desirable, having too much supply relative to demand can be problematic for companies.\\n\\n(C) stockpile: This refers to accumulating a large supply of something for future use. While some level of inventory is necessary for business operations, excessive stockpiling can tie up capital and lead to storage costs.\\n\\n(D) superabundance: Similar to "plentitude," this term denotes an excessive amount of something. Again, having more supply than demand can create issues for companies in terms of managing inventory and resources.\\n\\n(E) busy: This term doesn\'t directly relate to supply and demand dynamics in the context of most companies. It\'s more about activity levels or workload, which may or may not be related to demand.\\n\\nConsidering the options, the answer that most companies would not want relative to demand is (A) oversupply.

If someone is sitting quietly and their eyes are moving, it\'s unlikely they\'re reading because typically when people read, their eyes are focused on the text. Falling asleep seems contradictory since the person is described as sitting quietly. "Bunk" doesn\'t seem to fit the context either. \\n\\nThat leaves us with "meditate" and "think." Both of these options could potentially fit. When people meditate, their eyes may move slightly due to relaxation or focus on their thoughts. Similarly, when someone is deeply engaged in thought, their eyes may also move as they process information internally.\\n\\nConsidering the context of sitting quietly, both "meditate" and "think" seem plausible.

Foxes are known for being clever and opportunistic predators. They are often associated with raiding hen houses to prey on chickens, so having a fox there wouldn\'t be ideal. Also, fox hunting is a traditional English sport, so a fox wouldn\'t be safe there either. Foxes are adaptable creatures that can live in various habitats, including mountains, so having a fox in the mountains wouldn\'t necessarily be a problem unless you have specific concerns about livestock or wildlife. Having a fox outside your bedroom window could be bothersome, especially if they are noisy or causing disturbances.

It\'s asking about an activity that people enjoy doing while they\'re fishing, suggesting it\'s something relaxing. Fishing itself is often considered a leisure activity, so we\'re looking for something additional that people do while fishing.\\n\\nOption (A) "getting tied up lure" doesn\'t seem like a common activity associated with fishing. It\'s more about preparing the equipment rather than an additional relaxing activity.\\n\\nOption (B) "looking for information" also doesn\'t seem directly related to fishing as a secondary activity. It\'s too broad and not typically associated with the leisurely aspect of fishing.\\n\\nOption (C) "get wet" is unlikely because most people fishing prefer to stay dry. Getting wet would usually be an inconvenience rather than a relaxing activity.\\n\\nOption (D) "drink beer" is a common leisure activity that some people enjoy while fishing. It\'s relaxing and can enhance the experience for many individuals.\\n\\nOption (E) "sit quietly" is also a plausible choice. Many people enjoy the peace and tranquility of nature while fishing, which often involves sitting quietly and enjoying the surroundings.\\n\\nSo, considering the options, both (D) "drink beer" and (E) "sit quietly" seem like reasonable answers. However, since the question specifically mentions "another relaxing activity," and drinking beer can be seen as a separate activity from fishing, (E) "sit quietly" may be the better choice.', 'idx': 528}

Running is a physical activity that puts stress on the body, particularly the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. So, considering the options:\\n\\n(A) Breathlessness: When you run, your body requires more oxygen to fuel your muscles. Breathlessness occurs as a result of increased respiratory effort to meet this demand.\\n\\n(B) Increased heart rate: Running requires your heart to pump more blood to deliver oxygen and nutrients to your muscles. This leads to an increase in heart rate to meet the body's demand for oxygen-rich blood.\\n\\n(C) Falling down: While falling is a potential risk when running, it's not necessarily an unavoidable physiological consequence of running itself.\\n\\n(D) Muscle bulk: Running can contribute to muscle development, but muscle bulk is not necessarily an unavoidable consequence.

Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun, poses several challenges for human habitation. It lacks a breathable atmosphere, with temperatures that swing dramatically between extreme heat and cold due to its proximity to the Sun and lack of atmosphere to retain heat. Its surface is heavily cratered and lacks significant geological activity. Additionally, Mercury\'s surface is exposed to intense solar radiation and is bombarded by micrometeoroids. All these factors make it unsuitable for human life.\\n\\nNow let\'s match these characteristics to the options:\\n\\n(A) toxic - Mercury\'s surface is not breathable due to its lack of atmosphere, so toxic gases wouldn\'t be a primary concern. While Mercury does have a thin exosphere consisting of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind, it\'s not a major factor in its unsuitability for human life.\\n\\n(B) uninhabitable - This term encompasses the various inhospitable conditions on Mercury, making it a strong candidate for the correct answer.\\n\\n(C) mercury sulphide - This is a specific compound found on Earth and isn\'t directly related to Mercury\'s inhospitable conditions.\\n\\n(D) poisonous - While the conditions on Mercury could be described as "poisonous" in a broad sense, it\'s not the most accurate term to describe the overall inhospitable environment.\\n\\n(E) jupiter - This option is unrelated to the question and can be disregarded.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) uninhabitable.', 'idx': 819}

Similarly, the living room is a common area, but it's not inherently dangerous.\\n\\nThat leaves us with two options that could potentially pose a threat to the cat: the meatloaf and something not listed in the options. Given that Joe is panicking and fearing for the cat's life, it's reasonable to assume that the cat jumped into something that could harm it.\\n\\nSo, considering the options provided, the most likely answer is (A) meat loaf.", 'idx': 997}

It's possible for someone to feel envious if they see presents they wish they had received.\\n\\n(B) Jealousy: Similar to envy, jealousy involves feeling resentment or insecurity over someone else's possessions or achievements, often in relation to a perceived threat to one's own status or possessions.

One significant factor is that certain disabilities can affect cognitive abilities, making it challenging to process information, understand instructions, or retain knowledge. This difficulty can arise from conditions like dyslexia, ADHD, or autism spectrum disorders, which may impact attention, reading comprehension, or social interactions necessary for learning.\\n\\nAdditionally, physical disabilities can pose barriers to accessing educational materials or participating in classroom activities. For example, a student with mobility impairments may face challenges navigating campus buildings or using standard classroom equipment. Similarly, individuals with visual or hearing impairments may require accommodations such as Braille materials, sign language interpreters, or assistive technology to fully engage in academic tasks.\\n\\nMoreover, societal attitudes and lack of support can exacerbate the difficulties faced by students with disabilities. Negative stereotypes, stigma, or discrimination can lead to feelings of inadequacy or isolation, hindering academic performance and overall well-being. Without appropriate accommodations, individuals with disabilities may struggle to demonstrate their abilities and reach their full potential in academic settings.\\n\\nIn summary, having a disability can make academic tasks hard due to cognitive, physical, and social barriers that impact learning, accessibility, and inclusion. Providing adequate support, accommodations, and fostering an inclusive environment are essential for enabling individuals with disabilities to succeed academically.', 'idx': 1088}

You\'re describing a location where your linen closet is situated, and you\'re noting that it requires repainting with a light color due to having only one overhead light. This suggests that the space might be somewhat dim, hence the need for a lighter paint color to brighten it up.\\n\\nGiven the options, "house," "home," "pool house," "hallway," and "bedroom," we can eliminate some based on the context. The linen closet could be part of a house or home, but those terms are quite broad and don\'t specifically describe the space needing repainting. Similarly, a pool house wouldn\'t typically contain a linen closet, so we can eliminate that option as well.\\n\\nNow, let\'s consider the remaining options: "hallway" and "bedroom." A linen closet is commonly found in a hallway or a bedroom. However, since you mentioned that the space has only one overhead light, it seems more likely to be a hallway. Bedrooms typically have more than one light source, such as bedside lamps or additional overhead lights, whereas hallways often rely on just one overhead light.\\n\\nSo, based on the need for repainting and the presence of only one overhead light, the most suitable option among the given choices would be (D) hallway.
