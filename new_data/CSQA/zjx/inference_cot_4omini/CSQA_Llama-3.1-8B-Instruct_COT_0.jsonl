In the black yonder: "Yonder" is an old-fashioned word for a distant place or direction, often used to describe something that is far away. In this context, it\'s likely referring to the sky.\n\nConsidering these points, the correct answer is related to the location where James is seeing the stars. The options can be analyzed as follows:\n\n- (A) universe: The universe is the vast expanse of all existence, which is a bit too broad for the context.\n- (B) orbit: An orbit is a path that an object follows around a larger body, but it\'s not directly related to the twinkling stars.\n- (C) night sky: This is the most likely answer, as it\'s the area of the sky that James is looking at, where the stars are twinkling.\n- (D) outer space: Outer space is a broader term that refers to the vastness of space beyond Earth\'s atmosphere, which includes the stars, but it\'s not as specific as the night sky.\n- (E) his wallet: This option is unrelated to the context of the question.\n\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is (C).', 'idx': 108}

This option is too specific and doesn't account for other possible motivations.\n\n2. **Get laid (B)**: Similar to option A, this is a specific outcome of flirting, but it doesn't explain why someone would engage in flirting behavior in the first place.\n\n3. **Were lonely (C)**: This option is a possible reason, as someone who is lonely might try to connect with multiple people to alleviate their feelings of isolation. However, it's not the most likely reason, as loneliness might lead to more meaningful connections rather than superficial flirting.\n\n4. **Attract attention (D)**: This option is a strong possibility. Flirting can be a way to get attention, validation, or a sense of importance from others. People might engage in flirting behavior to feel seen, heard, or appreciated.\n\n5. **Dance (E)**: This option is unrelated to the context of flirting. Dancing can be a form of self-expression or social interaction, but it's not a reason for flirting.\n\nConsidering these options, the most likely reasons for someone to flirt with many people at once are to **attract attention**. This behavior can be a way to seek validation, feel important, or boost one's self-esteem.\n\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is (D).", 'idx': 692}

They can be pruned to maintain a desired size.\n\nConsidering these factors, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **A. Flower pot**: A flower pot is a good option for an ivy plant, as it provides a contained space for the plant to grow.\n- **B. Shelf**: A shelf can be a suitable option, but it might not provide the best support for an ivy plant to climb or trail.\n- **C. Windowsill**: A windowsill is a good option, as it provides bright, indirect light and can be a suitable spot for an ivy plant to grow.\n- **D. Outside**: Ivy plants can thrive outside in the right conditions, but they can also be invasive in some areas. This option depends on the specific type of ivy and local regulations.\n- **E. Sill**: This option is similar to a windowsill and can be a good spot for an ivy plant.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most suitable options for an ivy plant are A, C, and E.

This situation is extremely critical and can be life-threatening. \n\nFirstly, the plane will start to descend due to the loss of lift and thrust. This is not a stall, as a stall is a specific condition where the wing produces less lift than the weight of the plane, but it's not directly related to engine failure.\n\nThe engines won't start melting, as they are made of metal and other materials that can withstand high temperatures, but not the extreme conditions of flight without power.\n\nTaxiing is when an airplane moves on the ground, not in the air, so this option is not relevant.\n\nCrashing is a possible outcome if the plane is unable to maintain altitude and control, but it's not the immediate effect of the engine failure.\n\nSpeeding up is not a likely outcome, as the plane will lose power and altitude, not gain speed.\n\nConsidering these points, the most likely outcome of airplane engines cutting off and being unable to be restarted in flight is a loss of control and potential descent, which can lead to a crash.

The question is about someone committing perjury, which means giving false testimony under oath.\n2. The question asks what he had that would allow him to get away with it.\n3. The phrase "get away with it" implies a sense of impunity or the ability to avoid consequences.\n4. Among the options, we need to find something that relates to the ability to commit perjury without being caught or punished.\n\nLet\'s examine the options:\n\n(A) Confidence: Having confidence might make someone more likely to commit perjury, but it\'s not directly related to getting away with it.\n(B) Go to jail: This is the opposite of getting away with it.\n(C) Telling lies: Telling lies is a part of perjury, but it\'s not what allows someone to get away with it.\n(D) Lying: Similar to telling lies, lying is a part of perjury, but it\'s not what allows someone to get away with it.\n(E) Manual: This option doesn\'t relate to the context of perjury or getting away with it.\n\nConsidering the options, none of them directly answer the question. However, if we look at the options as a whole, we can see that options (A), (C), and (D) all relate to the act of lying or perjury. Among these, (A) confidence is the most fitting answer, as having confidence in one\'s ability to deceive or lie might make someone more likely to commit perjury and get away with it.\n\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is (A).', 'idx': 1011}
