"Unbreakable" is similar to "indestructible."\\n\\nConsidering the context of something that seems fragile but serves a strong purpose, "durable" (B) is likely the best fit since it acknowledges the film\'s strength without claiming it can never be destroyed. \\n\\nHowever, if we are focusing on the idea of absolute strength suggested in the word "fragile," then one of the terms implying total resistance like "indestructible" or "unbreakable" would fit better.\\n\\nBased on this reasoning, it\'s a tough decision, but "indestructible" comes across as a more definitive match for the contrast implied, despite the redundancy in options A and D. \\n\\nTherefore, from the options provided, the answer is (A) indestructible. \\n\\nTherefore, among A through E, the answer is (A).', 'idx': 22}
