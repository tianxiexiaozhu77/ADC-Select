Billy is trying to find a hole but cannot. This suggests that he is searching for a physical opening or gap. Given this, we can eliminate options A (notebook paper) and C (doughnut) as they do not typically have holes that one would search for.

Option E (bagel) also has a hole in the center, but it is not typically something one would 'scour' to find a hole. Finally, option D (golf course) makes sense as golf courses have holes that players aim for and could be difficult to find if obscured by grass or terrain.
