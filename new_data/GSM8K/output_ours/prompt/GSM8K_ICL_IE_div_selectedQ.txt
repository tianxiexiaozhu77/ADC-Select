Hasan is packing up his apartment because he’s moving across the country for a new job. He needs to ship several boxes to his new home. The movers have asked that Hasan avoid putting more than a certain weight in pounds in any cardboard box. The moving company has helpfully provided Hasan with a digital scale that will alert him if a package is too heavy. Hasan is in the kitchen, and he fills a cardboard box with 38 dinner plates. When he checks the box, the scale reports his box is too heavy. Hasan knows each of his plates weighs 10 ounces. He removes a single plate from the box and checks the movers’ scale again. The scale reports his box is still too heavy. Hasan repeats the process again and again. When he has removed enough plates, the movers’ scale shows the box is now an acceptable weight for shipping. Hasan deduces that each shipping box can hold 20 pounds before the scale says the box is too heavy.  How many plates did Hasan need to remove from the shipping box?


Sam works at the Widget Factory, assembling Widgets. He can assemble 1 widget every 10 minutes. Jack from the loading dock can help assemble widgets when he doesn't have anything else to do. When he helps, they put together 2 complete widgets every 15 minutes. Recently the factory hired Tony to help assemble widgets. Being new to the job, he doesn't work as fast as Sam or Jack. Yesterday Sam worked for 6 hours before he had to leave work early for a dentist appointment. Jack was able to help out for 4 hours before he had to go back to the loading dock to unload a new shipment of widget materials. Tony worked the entire 8-hour shift. At the end of the day, they had completed 68 widgets. How long does it take Tony to assemble a Widget, in minutes?


On Saturday morning, Renata had $10 to spend. She first went and made a $4 donation in exchange for a ticket to the local charity draw.

A man decides to try and do everything off his bucket list while he is still young and fit enough to finish it all.  One of his goals was to climb the seven summits.  He realizes first he has to get in shape to do it and it takes him 2 years of working out to get healthy enough to take up mountain climbing.  He then spends twice that long learning how to be a technically proficient mountain climber.  After that he starts with the simplest mountain on the list and climbs them all.  He spends 5 months climbing each mountain.  After that he takes 13 months learning to dive and dives through all the caves he wants in 2 years.  How much time did it take to get through all these goals?
