{"question": "Phoebe has two pizzas to share with her and three friends. One has pepperoni and the other has cheese. They both have 16 slices. They all eat the same amount. One friend eats only pepperoni, while the rest have an equal number of slices of each. At the end, there is one slice of pepperoni left and 7 slices of cheese, how many slices does each person eat?", "cot": "Phoebe and her three friends make a total of 4 people. There are 32 slices in total (16 per pizza). As per the question, one friend eats only pepperoni slices while the others share the remainders equally. There is 1 pepperoni slice and 7 cheese slices leftover after they eat. Therefore, there were originally 15 pepperoni slices eaten and 9 cheese slices eaten. If one friend ate only the pepperoni slices, and since they all ate the same amount of food, that means each consumed an equal fraction of the total 24 slices (32 total minus 8 leftover). Divide 24 slices by 4 people, we find each person ate 6 slices. Confirming this, the one friend would eat all 6 as pepperoni. For the others, if the 3 remaining people ate the same number of pepperoni and cheese slices, it can be deduced they would each have to eat 3 cheese slices because together they need to account for the 9 cheese slices eaten. Now for pepperoni, since the pepperoni-eating friend consumed all his slices as pepperoni, and there were 15 eaten total, the other 3 friends would split the remaining (15-6), i.e., 9 pepperoni slices. Thus, each of the 3 friends who ate both pepperoni and cheese would have eaten 3 pepperoni slices and 3 cheese slices, while the one who ate only pepperoni would have eaten 6 pepperoni slices.", "answer": "6", "score": 6.305418114216384}
{"question": "Tom and Jerry have a challenge to see who can eat more slices of pizza. Unfortunately, a mix-up results in Tom having a pizza cut into 3 slices per pie with 8 pies while Jerry\u2019s pizza has 4 slices per pie and 12 pies. When both finish their pizza, how many slices did they eat on average?", "cot": "First, calculate the total number of slices Tom ate by multiplying the number of pies he has by the number of slices per pie: 3 slices/pie * 8 pies = 24 slices. Next, calculate the total number of slices Jerry ate by doing the same: 4 slices/pie * 12 pies = 48 slices. To find the average number of slices they ate, add together the total slices Tom ate and the total slices Jerry ate, and then divide by the number of people (2): (24 slices + 48 slices) / 2 people = 72 slices / 2 people = 36 slices per person.", "answer": "36", "score": 5.226861085036562}
{"question": "Michael organized a pizza party for his office team. There are 7 men and 5 women on his team. Each man had 3 more slices of pizza than each woman. How many slices of pizza did Michael order if each woman ate 2 slices and there were no extras?", "cot": "First, calculate the number of slices each man ate. If each woman ate 2 slices and each man ate 3 more slices than each woman, each man ate 2 + 3 = 5 slices. With 7 men on the team, they consumed a total of 7 men * 5 slices/man = 35 slices. There are 5 women on the team and each ate 2 slices, so they consumed a total of 5 women * 2 slices/woman = 10 slices. Adding the slices eaten by men and women gives 35 slices + 10 slices = 45 slices. Thus, Michael ordered 45 slices of pizza for his team.", "answer": "45", "score": 5.46206376147467}
{"question": "Lily has a passion for arcade games and every week her brother gives her $50 to spend at the arcade. Games on weekends cost $4. Games on weekdays cost $3. Pizza slices cost $2 and sodas cost $1. It's the end of the week and it's a Sunday. She wants to make sure she has a slice of pizza and a soda that evening. How many games can she play if she already played 6 games on a weekend, 9 games on weekdays, ate 4 slices of pizza, and had 3 sodas that week?", "cot": "Lily starts with $50 for the week. She spends $24 on 6 weekend games ($4 each), $27 on 9 weekday games ($3 each), $8 on 4 slices of pizza ($2 each), and $3 on 3 sodas ($1 each). Total spent: $24 + $27 + $8 + $3 = $62. However, she only starts with $50, she must have planned extra for a Sunday game from previous savings as it's important to her, knowing Sunday games cost $4 and saving $3 for pizza and soda. She has overspent by $12 thus she can't play any more games today.", "answer": "0", "score": 5.975899182259498}
