{'question': "Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?", 'idx': 0, 'prompt': "Q: Jim's geese lay 20 eggs a day. He consumes two for his brunch each weekend and bakes cakes with six every Sunday. He sells the surplus eggs at the county fair daily for $2.50 per fresh goose egg. How much in dollars does he profit every day at the county fair?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nJim's geese lay 20 eggs a day. On weekends, he consumes 2 eggs for brunch and bakes cakes using 6 eggs on Sundays. Therefore, on Sundays, he uses a total of 8 eggs (2 for brunch + 6 for baking). This leaves him with 12 eggs to sell at the county fair on Sundays (20 - 8 = 12). On weekdays (Monday to Saturday), he doesn't consume any eggs, so he has all 20 eggs available to sell. He sells the surplus eggs at the county fair for $2.50 each. The daily profit is calculated by multiplying the number of eggs sold by the price per egg. On weekdays, he sells 20 eggs, making $50 (20 x 2.50), and on Sundays, he sells 12 eggs, making $30 (12 x 2.50). Therefore, his average daily profit at the county fair over the week can be calculated by taking into account the different eggs sold on Sundays and weekdays. However, the question specifically asks for profit every day. Therefore, for Sunday, it’s $30 profit, and for the other days, it’s $50 profit. On average, combining these profits over 7 days wouldn't give a daily profit since it's asked on a specific day-by-day basis. Thus, we will only provide the weekday profit and the Sunday profit. The question does not ask for an average.\nTherefore, the answer is (50)\n\nQ: Lisa's quails produce 30 eggs daily. She takes three for her lunch every afternoon and prepares a special dish every week with seven. She sells the leftover eggs at the craft fair each week for $1.50 per fresh quail egg. How much in dollars does she earn each week at the craft fair?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many eggs Lisa produces in a week. Since her quails produce 30 eggs daily, in one week (7 days), she will produce 30 eggs/day * 7 days = 210 eggs. Next, we must calculate how many eggs she personally uses. She takes 3 eggs for lunch each day, which totals to 3 eggs/day * 7 days = 21 eggs for the week. Additionally, she uses 7 eggs for a special dish each week. Therefore, her total egg usage is 21 eggs + 7 eggs = 28 eggs. The remaining eggs, which she sells at the craft fair, are calculated by subtracting her usage from her weekly production: 210 eggs - 28 eggs = 182 eggs left to sell. Since she sells each egg for $1.50, her total earnings from selling the leftover eggs are 182 eggs * $1.50/egg = $273. Therefore, the answer is (273).\nTherefore, the answer is (273)\n\nQ: Tom's hens lay 24 eggs each day. He has four for breakfast every morning and uses five for his famous omelets every week. He sells the remaining eggs at the local market daily for $3 per fresh chicken egg. How much in dollars does he make every day at the local market?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTom's hens lay 24 eggs each day. Every morning he has 4 eggs for breakfast, which means that he uses a total of 4 eggs daily. He also uses 5 eggs each week for his omelets. To find out how many eggs he uses daily for omelets, we divide 5 by 7 (since a week has 7 days), giving approximately 0.71 eggs per day. Now we add the breakfast and omelet usage: 4 (for breakfast) + 0.71 (for omelets) = 4.71 eggs used daily. Now, we subtract this from the total eggs produced daily: 24 - 4.71 = 19.29 eggs available for sale. Since he can only sell whole eggs, he will sell 19 eggs daily at the market. At $3 per egg, his daily income from selling eggs is 19 * 3 = $57. Thus, he makes $57 every day at the local market.\nTherefore, the answer is (57)\n\nQ: Anna's turkeys produce 18 eggs per day. She enjoys five for breakfast every morning and bakes special treats with three each week. She sells the rest at the neighborhood market daily for $2.20 per fresh turkey egg. How much in dollars does she generate every day at the neighborhood market?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nAnna's turkeys produce 18 eggs each day. She consumes 5 eggs for breakfast. This means that the number of eggs left for sale is 18 - 5 = 13 eggs. She also uses 3 eggs each week for baking, but since the question asks for daily revenue, we only focus on the daily leftover. Therefore, the total number of eggs available for sale each day is 13. Each egg is sold at $2.20, so the daily revenue from selling these eggs is 13 * 2.20 = 28.6 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (28.6).)\n\nQuestion: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs each day.
