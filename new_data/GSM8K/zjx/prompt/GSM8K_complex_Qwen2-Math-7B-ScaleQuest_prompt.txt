Q: You can buy 4 apples or 1 watermelon for the same price. You bought 36 fruits evenly split between oranges, apples and watermelons, and the price of 1 orange is $0.50. How much does 1 apple cost if your total bill was $66?
A: Let's think step by step. 
To determine the cost of one apple, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of fruits and their types:**
   - You bought 36 fruits in total.
   - The fruits are evenly split between oranges, apples, and watermelons.
   - Therefore, the number of each type of fruit is:
     \[
     \frac{36}{3} = 12
     \]
     So, you bought 12 oranges, 12 apples, and 12 watermelons.

2. **Determine the total cost of the oranges:**
   - The price of one orange is $0.50.
   - The total cost of the oranges is:
     \[
     12 \times 0.50 = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Let the cost of one apple be \(a\) dollars and the cost of one watermelon be \(w\) dollars.**
   - Since the price of 4 apples is equal to the price of 1 watermelon, we have:
     \[
     4a = w
     \]
   - The total cost of the apples and watermelons together is:
     \[
     12a + 12w
     \]
   - The total bill is $66, so the total cost of the apples and watermelons is:
     \[
     66 - 6 = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     12a + 12w = 60
     \]
   - Substituting \(w = 4a\) into the equation, we get:
     \[
     12a + 12(4a) = 60
     \]
     \[
     12a + 48a = 60
     \]
     \[
     60a = 60
     \]
     \[
     a = 1
     \]
4. **Conclusion:**
   - The cost of one apple is \(\boxed{1}\) dollar.]

Q: Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees. She also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards. If she buys 2/5 times more of each item, what would be the total number of the items she will have if she currently has 60 marbles?
A: Let's think step by step. 
To determine the total number of items Bella will have after buying more, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of frisbees Bella currently has:**
   Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees. Let \( F \) be the number of frisbees. Since she has 60 marbles, we can write:
   \[
   2F = 60
   \]
   Solving for \( F \):
   \[
   F = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]
   So, Bella currently has 30 frisbees.

2. **Determine the number of deck cards Bella currently has:**
   Bella has 20 more frisbees than deck cards. Let \( D \) be the number of deck cards. We can write:
   \[
   F = D + 20
   \]
   Since \( F = 30 \), we substitute 30 for \( F \):
   \[
   30 = D + 20
   \]
   Solving for \( D \):
   \[
   D = 30 - 20 = 10
   \]
   So, Bella currently has 10 deck cards.

3. **Calculate the number of each item after buying more:**
   Bella buys \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more of each item. Therefore, the number of marbles she will have is:
   \[
   60 + \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 60 + \frac{120}{5} = 60 + 24 = 84
   \]
   The number of frisbees she will have is:
   \[
   30 + \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = 30 + \frac{60}{5} = 30 + 12 = 42
   \]
   The number of deck cards she will have is:
   \[
   10 + \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 10 + \frac{20}{5} = 10 + 4 = 14
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of items:**
   The total number of items is the sum of the marbles, frisbees, and deck cards:
   \[
   84 + 42 + 14 = 140
   \]
Therefore, the total number of items Bella will have is \(\boxed{140}\). output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 140 output: 14.


Q: Susy goes to a large school with 800 students, while Sarah goes to a smaller school with only 300 students.  At the start of the school year, Susy had 100 social media followers.  She gained 40 new followers in the first week of the school year, half that in the second week, and half of that in the third week.  Sarah only had 50 social media followers at the start of the year, but she gained 90 new followers the first week, a third of that in the second week, and a third of that in the third week.  After three weeks, how many social media followers did the girl with the most total followers have?
A: Let's think step by step. 
To determine how many social media followers the girl with the most total followers has after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of followers each girl has at the end of the third week and then compare the two.

First, let's calculate Susy's total number of followers after three weeks.

1. **Initial followers:**
   Susy starts with 100 followers.

2. **Followers gained in the first week:**
   Susy gains 40 new followers.
   \[
   \text{Followers after the first week} = 100 + 40 = 140
   \]

3. **Followers gained in the second week:**
   Susy gains half of 40 new followers.
   \[
   \text{Followers gained in the second week} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Followers after the second week} = 140 + 20 = 160
   \]

4. **Followers gained in the third week:**
   Susy gains half of 20 new followers.
   \[
   \text{Followers gained in the third week} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Followers after the third week} = 160 + 10 = 170
   \]

So, after three weeks, Susy has 170 followers.

Next, let's calculate Sarah's total number of followers after three weeks.

1. **Initial followers:**
   Sarah starts with 50 followers.

2. **Followers gained in the first week:**
   Sarah gains 90 new followers.
   \[
   \text{Followers after the first week} = 50 + 90 = 140
   \]

3. **Followers gained in the second week:**
   Sarah gains a third of 90 new followers.
   \[
   \text{Followers gained in the second week} = \frac{90}{3} = 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Followers after the second week} = 140 + 30 = 170
   \]

4. **Followers gained in the third week:**
   Sarah gains a third of 30 new followers.
   \[
   \text{Followers gained in the third week} = \frac{30}{3} = 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Followers after the third week} = 170 + 10 = 180
   \]

So, after three weeks, Sarah has 180 followers.

Comparing the two, Sarah has more followers than Susy. Therefore, the girl with the most total followers after three weeks is Sarah, and she has 180 followers.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{180}
\]

In a math competition, a problem involves a sequence of numbers where each term is the sum of the squares of the digits of the previous term. Starting with the number 23, the sequence is generated as follows: the first term is 23, the second term is $2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13$, the third term is $1^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 9 = 10$, and the fourth term is $1^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 0 = 1$. The sequence continues with the fifth term being $1^2 = 1$, and so on. Determine the number of distinct terms in this sequence.
To determine the number of distinct terms in the sequence, we start by generating the terms step by step and identifying any repeating patterns.

1. The first term is 23.
2. The second term is \(2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13\).
3. The third term is \(1^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 9 = 10\).
4. The fourth term is \(1^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 0 = 1\).
5. The fifth term is \(1^2 = 1\).

From the fifth term onwards, the sequence will continue to be 1, 1, 1, ... because the square of 1 is 1. Therefore, the sequence becomes periodic with the term 1 repeating indefinitely.

Now, we list all the distinct terms in the sequence: 23, 13, 10, 1. There are no other terms because the sequence repeats from the fourth term onwards.
Thus.


Q: Mark's basketball team scores 25 2 pointers, 8 3 pointers and 10 free throws.  Their opponents score double the 2 pointers but half the 3 pointers and free throws.  What's the total number of points scored by both teams added together?
A: Let's think step by step. 
To determine the total number of points scored by both teams, we need to calculate the points scored by each team and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the points scored by Mark's team:
- Each 2-pointer is worth 2 points. So, the points from 2-pointers are:
  \[
  25 \times 2 = 50
  \]
- Each 3-pointer is worth 3 points. So, the points from 3-pointers are:
  \[
  8 \times 3 = 24
  \]
- Each free throw is worth 1 point. So, the points from free throws are:
  \[
  10 \times 1 = 10
  \]
- Adding these together, the total points scored by Mark's team are:
  \[
  50 + 24 + 10 = 84
  \]

Next, let's calculate the points scored by the opponents:
- The opponents score double the number of 2-pointers that Mark's team scored. So, the number of 2-pointers scored by the opponents is:
  \[
  2 \times 25 = 50
  \]
- The opponents score half the number of 3-pointers that Mark's team scored. So, the number of 3-pointers scored by the opponents is:
  \[
  \frac{8}{2} = 4
  \]
- The opponents score half the number of free throws that Mark's team scored. So, the number of free throws scored by the opponents is:
  \[
  \frac{10}{2} = 5
  \]
- Each 2-pointer is worth 2 points, so the points from 2-pointers are:
  \[
  50 \times 2 = 100
  \]
- Each 3-pointer is worth 3 points, so the points from 3-pointers are:
  \[
  4 \times 3 = 12
  \]
- Each free throw is worth 1 point, so the points from free throws are:
  \[
  5 \times 1 = 5
  \]
- Adding these together, the total points scored by the opponents are:
  \[
  100 + 12 + 5 = 117
  \]

Finally, the total number of points scored by both teams added together is:
\[
84 + 117 = 201
\]
So, the total number of points scored by both teams is \(\boxed{201}\).].
