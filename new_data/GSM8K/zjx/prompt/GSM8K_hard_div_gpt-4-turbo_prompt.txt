Q: Alec is running for Class President. He thinks that if he can get three-quarters of the class to vote for him then there is no chance anyone else can beat him. Half of the class have already said they will vote for him but out of the remaining students, only 5 have said they are thinking about voting for him. He surveys the students who are thinking about voting for someone else, and changes his flyers to reflect the issues these students are concerned about. This results in a fifth of these students saying they'll vote for him. If Alec's class has 60 students and everyone who said they will vote for him does so, how many more votes does Alec need to reach his goal number of votes?
A: Let's think step by step. 
First, determine the total number of votes Alec needs to secure three-quarters of the class. Three-quarters of 60 students is 45 votes (0.75 * 60 = 45). Initially, half of the class, or 30 students (0.5 * 60 = 30), have already committed to voting for him. This leaves another half, or 30 students, who have not yet committed to voting for him. Out of these remaining 30 students, 5 are considering voting for him. Alec then influences a fifth of the remaining 25 students (those not yet considering voting for him) after changing his flyers. A fifth of 25 is 5 students (0.2 * 25 = 5). Adding these 5 students to the 5 who were already considering voting for him gives a total of 10 additional potential voters. Adding these 10 potential voters to the initial 30 committed voters gives Alec a total of 40 votes (30 + 10 = 40). To reach his goal of 45 votes, Alec needs 5 more votes (45 - 40 = 5).
Therefore, the answer is (5).


Q: Hasan is packing up his apartment because he’s moving across the country for a new job. He needs to ship several boxes to his new home. The movers have asked that Hasan avoid putting more than a certain weight in pounds in any cardboard box. The moving company has helpfully provided Hasan with a digital scale that will alert him if a package is too heavy. Hasan is in the kitchen, and he fills a cardboard box with 38 dinner plates. When he checks the box, the scale reports his box is too heavy. Hasan knows each of his plates weighs 10 ounces. He removes a single plate from the box and checks the movers’ scale again. The scale reports his box is still too heavy. Hasan repeats the process again and again. When he has removed enough plates, the movers’ scale shows the box is now an acceptable weight for shipping. Hasan deduces that each shipping box can hold 20 pounds before the scale says the box is too heavy.  How many plates did Hasan need to remove from the shipping box?
A: Let's think step by step. 
First, we calculate the total weight of the 38 dinner plates that Hasan initially had in the box. Since each plate weighs 10 ounces, the total weight of 38 plates is 38 * 10 = 380 ounces. We need to convert this weight to pounds because the movers' scale limit is in pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so 380 ounces is equivalent to 380 / 16 = 23.75 pounds. Since the weight limit for the boxes is 20 pounds, Hasan's box is initially 3.75 pounds over the limit. To determine how many plates he needs to remove, we calculate how many plates make up the excess weight. Each plate weighs 10 ounces, which is 10 / 16 = 0.625 pounds. The excess weight of 3.75 pounds divided by the weight of one plate (0.625 pounds) gives us 3.75 / 0.625 = 6 plates. Therefore, Hasan needs to remove 6 plates to meet the weight limit of 20 pounds.
Therefore, the answer is (6).


Q: Sam works at the Widget Factory, assembling Widgets. He can assemble 1 widget every 10 minutes. Jack from the loading dock can help assemble widgets when he doesn't have anything else to do. When he helps, they put together 2 complete widgets every 15 minutes. Recently the factory hired Tony to help assemble widgets. Being new to the job, he doesn't work as fast as Sam or Jack. Yesterday Sam worked for 6 hours before he had to leave work early for a dentist appointment. Jack was able to help out for 4 hours before he had to go back to the loading dock to unload a new shipment of widget materials. Tony worked the entire 8-hour shift. At the end of the day, they had completed 68 widgets. How long does it take Tony to assemble a Widget, in minutes?
A: Let's think step by step. 
First, calculate how many widgets Sam and Jack can assemble alone. Sam assembles 1 widget every 10 minutes, so in 60 minutes (1 hour), he can assemble 6 widgets. Given he worked for 6 hours, he alone would assemble 6 widgets/hour * 6 hours = 36 widgets. Next, calculate the joint productivity of Sam and Jack. Together, they make 2 widgets every 15 minutes, equating to 8 widgets per hour. Jack helped for 4 hours, so together they made 8 widgets/hour * 4 hours = 32 widgets. Since Tony worked the entire 8-hour shift, and they completed a total of 68 widgets, we need to find Tony's contribution. Subtract the combined production of Sam and Jack from the total: 68 widgets - 36 widgets - 32 widgets = 0 widgets. This indicates Tony did not complete any widgets on his own during the 8 hours he worked. Therefore, Tony's rate of assembling widgets is effectively zero, or he requires infinitely long to assemble a widget.
Therefore, the answer is (infinity).


Q: On Saturday morning, Renata had $10 to spend. She first went and made a $4 donation in exchange for a ticket to the local charity draw. When the draw was done, she was declared the winner of the 5th prize of $90. Excited, she quickly dashed to play slots at one of the casinos in Atlantic City. Unfortunately, she lost $50 at the first slot machine, $10 at the second and $5 at the last one.  Dejected, she decided to take a long walk. She soon grew thirsty and entered the first gas station she saw. She picked a $1 bottle of water and while paying for it, she bought a $1 lottery ticket. To her utter delight, she won an instant prize of $65. How much money did Renata end up having?
A: Let's think step by step. 
Renata started with $10. She made a $4 donation reducing her amount to $6. Winning the 5th prize of $90, she then had $96. After losing $50, $10, and $5 at the slots, her money dropped to $31. Buying a $1 water bottle and a $1 lottery ticket, she spent $2, reducing her cash to $29. Winning $65 from the lottery ticket increased her total to $94.
Therefore, the answer is (94).
