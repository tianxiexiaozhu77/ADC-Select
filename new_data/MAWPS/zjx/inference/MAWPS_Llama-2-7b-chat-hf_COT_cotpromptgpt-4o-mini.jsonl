We know that the total amount of grain on the ship was 50000 tons (49952 + 918 = 50000).\n\nSo, to find the original amount of grain, we need to subtract the amount that spilled into the water from the total amount on the ship:\n\n50000 - 49952 = 1080\n\nTherefore, the answer is (5.0).", 'true_answer': 50870.0}

Let's break it down step by step:\n\nWe know that there are currently 31 short trees in the park.\nWe also know that the workers will plant short trees today, which will increase the total number of short trees in the park.\nWe want to find out how many short trees the workers planted today.\n\nLet's use the information we have to solve the problem:\n\nTotal number of short trees in the park = 31\nNumber of short trees the workers will plant today = ?\n\nWe can start by adding the number of short trees the workers will plant today to the total number of short trees in the park:\n\nTotal number of short trees in the park + Number of short trees the workers will plant today = ?\n\nNow, let's substitute the values we know:\n\nTotal number of short trees in the park + Number of short trees the workers will plant today = 31 + ?\n\nWe want to find out the value of ?, which represents the number of short trees the workers will plant today.\n\nTo do this, we can use the information that there will be 95 short trees in the park after the workers are finished. We can subtract the total number of short trees in the park before the workers started planting from the total number of short trees in the park after the workers are finished:\n\n95 short trees in the park after workers are finished - 31 short trees in the park before workers started planting = ?\n\nNow, let's solve for ?:\n\n95 - 31 = ?\n\nThe answer is 64.\n\nTherefore, the workers planted 64 short trees today.\n\nThe final answer is (64).", 'true_answer': 64.0}
