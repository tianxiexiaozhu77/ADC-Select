However, the answer is not a whole number, so we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not 11.0, it is 11.2, but we can round it to 11.0, but the answer is not', 'true_answer': 0.9166666667}

Since we know the distance he rode is 3.8333333333333335 miles and the distance he walked is 0.16666666666666666 miles, we can simply subtract the distance walked from the distance ridden:\nDistance ridden - Distance walked = 3.8333333333333335 - 0.16666666666666666\n= 3.6666666666666665\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3.7.", 'true_answer': 3.6666666667}

We can do this by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:\n-x = 16 - 6\n-x = 10\n\nNow, to get 'x' by itself, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1:\nx = -10\n\nHowever, since we can't have a negative number of roses, this doesn't make sense in this context. Let's re-examine the problem. \n\nThe correct equation should be: \nInitial number of roses + Number of roses cut = Total number of roses after cutting\n6 + x = 16\n\nNow, let's solve for 'x':\nx = 16 - 6\nx = 10\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10.", 'true_answer': 10.0}

0.166666666666667 = 9.999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999", 'true_answer': 10.6666666667}
