But, if only 21 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "Sure, let's break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, let's find out how many apples were ordered in total. The cafeteria ordered 33 red apples and 23 green apples, so the total number of apples ordered is:\\n\\n33 (red apples) + 23 (green apples) = 56 apples\\n\\nNext, we need to figure out how many apples each student would get if all 21 students wanted fruit. To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of students:\\n\\n56 apples ÷ 21 students ≈ 2.666 apples per student\\n\\nSince we can't have a fraction of an apple, we'll round this number down to the nearest whole number, which is 2. So, if all 21 students wanted fruit, each student would get 2 apples.\\n\\nNow, let's find out how many apples were actually needed for the 21 students. Since each student would get 2 apples, we multiply the number of students by 2:\\n\\n21 students × 2 apples/student = 42 apples\\n\\nSo, if all 21 students wanted fruit, they would need 42 apples in total.\\n\\nFinally, let's find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with. To do this, we subtract the number of apples needed for the 21 students from the total number of apples ordered:\\n\\n56 apples (total) - 42 apples (needed) = 14 extra apples\\n\\nTherefore, the cafeteria ended up with 14 extra apples.", 'true_answer': [35.0]}

Since there are 2 scarves in each box, and Chloe has 4 boxes, we can multiply the number of scarves in each box by the total number of boxes: \\n\\n2 scarves/box * 4 boxes = 8 scarves\\n\\nNext, let's calculate how many mittens Chloe has. Similar to the scarves, there are 6 mittens in each box, and Chloe has 4 boxes:\\n\\n6 mittens/box * 4 boxes = 24 mittens\\n\\nNow, to find out how many pieces of winter clothing Chloe has in total, we simply add the number of scarves and mittens together:\\n\\nTotal winter clothing = Number of scarves + Number of mittens\\nTotal winter clothing = 8 scarves + 24 mittens = 32 pieces\\n\\nSo, Chloe has a total of 32 pieces of winter clothing.", 'true_answer': [32.0]}

She had 6 pages of reading homework, and each page also had 4 problems:\\n\\n6 pages * 4 problems per page = 24 reading problems\\n\\nNow, to find the total number of problems she had to complete, we add the number of math problems to the number of reading problems:\\n\\n16 math problems + 24 reading problems = 40 problems in total\\n\\nSo, Sarah had to complete a total of 40 problems.", 'true_answer': [40.0]}

She planted 36 seeds in the big garden, and for each small garden, she planted 2 seeds. So the total number of seeds planted is:\\n\\n36 (big garden) + 2 * (number of small gardens)\\n\\nNext, we subtract the total number of seeds planted from the initial number of seeds Emily started with:\\n\\n42 (initial seeds) - (36 + 2 * number of small gardens)\\n\\nThis equation will give us the remaining number of seeds that Emily didn't plant. We know she didn't plant any more seeds after the initial planting, so this remaining number of seeds should be zero. We can set up the equation:\\n\\n42 - (36 + 2 * number of small gardens) = 0\\n\\nNow, let's solve for the number of small gardens. First, we simplify the equation:\\n\\n42 - 36 - 2 * number of small gardens = 0\\n\\n6 - 2 * number of small gardens = 0\\n\\nNext, we isolate the term with the variable:\\n\\n-2 * number of small gardens = -6\\n\\nNow, divide both sides by -2:\\n\\nnumber of small gardens = -6 / -2\\n\\nnumber of small gardens = 3\\n\\nSo, Emily had 3 small gardens.", 'true_answer': [3.0]}
