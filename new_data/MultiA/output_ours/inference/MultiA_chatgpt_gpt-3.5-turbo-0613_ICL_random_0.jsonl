She uploaded 35 pictures from her phone and 5 from her camera, so the total number of pictures she uploaded is \\(35 + 5 = 40\\).\\n\\nStep 2: Next, let's figure out how many pictures will be in each album. Since Robin sorted the pictures into 5 different albums with the same amount of pictures in each, we need to divide the total number of pictures (40) by the number of albums (5): \\(40 \\div 5 = 8\\).\\n\\nStep 3: Therefore, there were 8 pictures in each of the albums.

He bought 10 regular sodas, and if each shelf can hold 4 sodas, we divide 10 by 4.\\n\\n10 regular sodas ÷ 4 sodas per shelf = 2.5 shelves\\n\\nSince we can't have half a shelf, George would need to use 3 shelves for the regular sodas.\\n\\nNext, let's do the same calculation for the diet sodas. George bought 22 diet sodas.\\n\\n22 diet sodas ÷ 4 sodas per shelf = 5.5 shelves\\n\\nAgain, we can't have half a shelf, so George would need 6 shelves for the diet sodas.\\n\\nNow, to find out how many shelves he would fill up in total, we add the number of shelves needed for the regular sodas and the diet sodas.\\n\\n3 shelves for regular sodas + 6 shelves for diet sodas = 9 shelves in total\\n\\nSo, George would fill up 9 shelves in total for the sodas at his birthday party.", 'true_answer': [8.0]}

Using the same logic:\\n\\n\\[ \\text{Number of full trips for 52 trays} = \\frac{52}{9} \\]\\n\\nDividing 52 by 9 results in a quotient of approximately 5 with a remainder of 7.

Since he can only carry 7 trays at a time, he will need to make \\( \\frac{23}{7} \\) trips to pick up all the trays from that table.\\n\\n\\( \\frac{23}{7} \\) is approximately \\(3.29\\), but since he can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, he'll make 4 trips to pick up all 23 trays from the first table.\\n\\nNext, Victor needs to pick up 5 trays from another table. Since he can still only carry 7 trays at a time, he will need to make \\( \\frac{5}{7} \\) trips to pick up all the trays from that table.\\n\\n\\( \\frac{5}{7} \\) is less than 1, so again, he'll need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, he'll make 1 trip to pick up all 5 trays from the second table.\\n\\nIn total, Victor will make \\( 4 + 1 = 5 \\) trips to pick up all the trays.\\n\\nSo, the answer is 5 trips.", 'true_answer': [4.0]}

So, 18 - 8 = 10 cupcakes.\\n\\nNow, let's move on to the next part of the question:\\n\\n4. **Cupcakes in each package**: Katie wants to put 2 cupcakes in each package.\\n\\nNow, we'll determine how many packages she can make:\\n\\n5. **Number of packages**: To find out how many packages Katie can make with the remaining cupcakes, we divide the number of remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes in each package. So, 10 cupcakes ÷ 2 cupcakes per package = 5 packages.\\n\\nSo, Katie can make 5 packages of cupcakes with the remaining 10 cupcakes.", 'true_answer': [5.0]}
