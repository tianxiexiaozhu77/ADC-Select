Since each baggie contains 5 cookies, we divide 33 by 5 to find out how many baggies she can make with chocolate chip cookies alone. \\n\\n33 divided by 5 equals 6 with a remainder of 3. This means she can make 6 baggies with 5 chocolate chip cookies each, and she will have 3 chocolate chip cookies left over.\\n\\nNext, let's consider the oatmeal cookies. She has 2 oatmeal cookies. Since they can't fill a whole baggie, we don't need to divide.\\n\\nSo, in total, Maria can make 6 baggies with chocolate chip cookies and she won't be able to make any baggies with oatmeal cookies since she doesn't have enough. Therefore, she can make 6 baggies in total.", 'true_answer': [7.0]}

If Haley recycled 11 pounds and her friends recycled 16 pounds, how many points did they earn? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "First, let's find out how many points Haley earned for recycling. She recycled 11 pounds, and for every 3 pounds, she earns 1 point. So, to find out how many points she earned, we divide 11 by 3, which equals 3 with a remainder of 2. Since each set of 3 pounds earns 1 point, Haley earned 3 points for the full sets and an additional point for the remainder. So, Haley earned 3 + 1 = 4 points.\\n\\nNext, let's calculate how many points her friends earned for recycling. They recycled 16 pounds. Following the same logic, for every 3 pounds, they earn 1 point. Dividing 16 by 3 gives us 5 with a remainder of 1. So, her friends earned 5 points for the full sets and an additional point for the remainder. Thus, Haley's friends earned 5 + 1 = 6 points.\\n\\nNow, to find out how many points they earned altogether, we add Haley's points to her friends' points. So, 4 (Haley's points) + 6 (her friends' points) = 10 points in total. Thus, Haley and her friends earned 10 points for recycling paper for their class.", 'true_answer': [9.0]}
