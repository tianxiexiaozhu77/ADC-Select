If she sorted the pics into 5 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pictures were in each of the albums, we need to first calculate the total number of pictures Tiffany uploaded. She uploaded 7 pictures from her phone and 13 from her camera, so the total number of pictures is 7 + 13 = 20. Since she wants to sort them into 5 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums (5) to find out how many pictures are in each album.
