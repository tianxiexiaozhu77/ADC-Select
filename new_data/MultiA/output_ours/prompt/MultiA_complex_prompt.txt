Q:  Tiffany uploaded 7 pictures from her phone and 13 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 5 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To find out how many pictures were in each of the albums, we need to first calculate the total number of pictures Tiffany uploaded. She uploaded 7 pictures from her phone and 13 from her camera, so the total number of pictures is 7 + 13 = 20. Since she wants to sort them into 5 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums (5) to find out how many pictures are in each album. Therefore, 20 / 5 = 4.
Therefore, the answer is (4.0)


Q:  Oliver is at the library helping put away books. There are 46 book to put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with the rest. If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
Since the librarian took 10 books, Oliver is left with 46 - 10 = 36 books to put away. If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, then he would need 36 / 4 = 9 shelves to put away all the remaining books.
Therefore, the answer is (9.0)


Q:  Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 8 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To find out how many pictures were in each of the albums, we need to first calculate the total number of pictures Olivia uploaded. She uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera, which gives a total of 5 + 35 = 40 pictures. Since she sorted the pictures into 8 different albums with the same amount of pictures in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums (40 / 8 = 5). Therefore, there were 5 pictures in each of the albums.
Therefore, the answer is (5.0)


Q:  Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 8 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
Olivia uploaded a total of 40 pictures (5 from her phone + 35 from her camera). To divide these pictures into 8 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, we need to find a number that is divisible by 8. However, 40 is not divisible evenly by 8, so it's not possible to have an equal number of pictures in each album.
Therefore, the answer is (5.0)


Q:  Vanessa and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 9 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Vanessa recycled 20 pounds and her friends recycled 16 pounds, how many points did they earn? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
Vanessa recycled 20 pounds, earning 2 points (20 pounds / 9 pounds = 2.22, rounded down to 2). Her friends recycled 16 pounds, earning 1 point (16 pounds / 9 pounds = 1.77, rounded down to 1). Therefore, Vanessa and her friends earned a total of 3 points.
Therefore, the answer is (4.0)


Q:  Katie uploaded 30 pictures from her phone and 51 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 9 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To find out how many pictures were in each album, we need to first calculate the total number of pictures Katie uploaded. She uploaded 30 pictures from her phone and 51 from her camera, which gives us a total of 30 + 51 = 81 pictures. Since she sorted the pictures into 9 different albums with the same amount of pictures in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums (81 / 9 = 9). Therefore, there were 9 pictures in each of the albums.
Therefore, the answer is (9.0)


Q:  Robin uploaded 35 pictures from her phone and 5 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 5 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To find out how many pictures were in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. Robin uploaded a total of 40 pictures (35 from her phone + 5 from her camera). Since she sorted the pictures into 5 different albums, we can divide 40 by 5 to find out how many pictures were in each album.
Therefore, the answer is (8.0)


Q:  Isabel uploaded 2 pictures from her phone and 4 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 3 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
Isabel uploaded a total of 6 pictures (2 from her phone + 4 from her camera). Since she wants to sort them into 3 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, we need to find a number that can be divided equally by 3. However, 6 is not divisible by 3 without any remainder, so it's not possible to have an equal number of pictures in each album.
Therefore, the answer is (2.0)
