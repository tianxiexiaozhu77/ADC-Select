Edward started with 35 games and sold 19, so he had 35 - 19 = 16 games left. He then packed these games into boxes of 8. To find out how many boxes he needed, we divide the total number of games by the number of games per box: 16 / 8 = 2.
Therefore, the answer is (2.0)


Q:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend?

Ned bought 11 games from a friend and 22 more at a garage sale, totaling 33 games. However, 19 of these games didn't work, so we subtract those from the total to find the number of good games: 33 - 19 = 14.

Edward bought 79 tickets and spent 23 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth, leaving him with 56 tickets for rides. Since each ride costs 7 tickets, we divide the total number of tickets left by the cost per ride: 56 / 7 = 8.

Q:  George was working as a sacker at a grocery store where he made 5 dollars an hour. On Monday he worked 7 hours and on Tuesday he worked 2 hours. How much money did George make in those two days? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To calculate the total amount of money George made, we first need to find out how much he earned each day. On Monday, he worked 7 hours at $5 per hour, so he earned 7 * $5 = $35. On Tuesday, he worked 2 hours at $5 per hour, so he earned 2 * $5 = $10. Adding these two amounts together gives us the total earnings: $35 + $10 = $45.
Therefore, the answer is (45.0)
