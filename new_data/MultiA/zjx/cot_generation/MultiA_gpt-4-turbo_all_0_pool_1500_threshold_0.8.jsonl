{"question": "Sarah was placing her photographs in an album with 6 photos on each page. After taking 5 new photos and having 53 old photos, how many album pages did she use?", "cot": "First, calculate the total number of photos Sarah has by adding her old photos and new photos. She has 53 old photos and she took 5 new ones, so 53 + 5 = 58 photos in total. Each album page can hold 6 photos, so to find the number of pages she used, divide the total number of photos by the number of photos each page can hold. Calculate 58 / 6 = 9.67. Since she can't use a fraction of a page, round up to the next whole number, which is 10. Therefore, Sarah used 10 full pages to hold all her photos.", "answer": "10", "score": 5.775066343549486}
{"question": "Tom shot 130 photos with his DSLR and 70 with his smartphone during his trip. If he created 20 different photo albums with the same number of photos in each album, how many photos were in each album?", "cot": "First, we find the total number of photos Tom shot: 130 photos with his DSLR plus 70 photos with his smartphone, which sum up to 200 photos in total. Then, since he created 20 different photo albums and each album has the same number of photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of albums. Therefore, 200 total photos divided by 20 albums equals 10 photos per album.", "answer": "10", "score": 5.270784134200925}
{"question": "Anna was sorting her photographs into albums. She had 3 albums for vacation photos and 2 albums for family events. If each album could contain 20 photographs, how many photographs did Anna organize?", "cot": "First, calculate the total number of albums Anna has for vacation photos and family events. She has 3 albums for vacation photos and 2 albums for family events, which adds up to 3 + 2 = 5 albums. Each album can contain 20 photographs. Therefore, to find the total number of photographs Anna organized, multiply the total number of albums by the number of photographs each album can contain: 5 albums * 20 photographs/album = 100 photographs.", "answer": "100", "score": 5.265235690321347}
{"question": "Alice needed to sort 100 old photos and label 50 new ones before her exhibition.

{"question": "Jennifer is sorting her photographs into an album with 8 photos per page. If she wants to archive 3 new photos and 17 old photos, how many pages will she use?", "cot": "First, let's calculate the total number of photos Jennifer wants to archive. She has 3 new photos and 17 old photos, which gives a total of 3 + 17 = 20 photos. Each page of her album holds 8 photos. To find out the total number of pages she will use, divide the total number of photos by the number of photos per page: 20 photos / 8 photos per page = 2.5 pages. Since she can't use half a page, she will need 3 full pages to accommodate all her photos.", "answer": "3", "score": 5.531342254805448}

{"question": "Sophie was filing her photographs in an album with 2 on each page. If she had 2 new photographs and 6 old photographs to put in the album, how many pages would she fill?", "cot": "First, we need to find the total number of photographs Sophie has, which is 2 new photographs plus 6 old photographs, equaling 8 photographs in total. Since each album page holds 2 photographs, we then divide the total number of photographs by 2 to find out how many pages she would fill. Since 8 divided by 2 equals 4, Sophie will fill 4 pages in her album.", "answer": "4", "score": 5.409372772547323}
