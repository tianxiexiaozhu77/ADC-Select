This is 5 (from phone) + 35 (from camera) = 40 pictures in total. Next, we are told that these pictures are evenly distributed into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. So, 40 pictures √∑ 8 albums = 5 pictures per album.\nTherefore, the answer is (5).\n\nQuestion:  Katie picked 3 tulips and 9 roses to make flower bouquets.

I'm here to help you with any questions you have.\n\nFor the first question, to find out how many pictures were in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. So, if Tiffany uploaded 20 pictures and sorted them into 5 albums, each album has 20 pictures / 5 albums = 4 pictures.\n\nFor the second question, to find out how many shelves Oliver will need, we divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold. So, if Oliver has 36 books and each shelf can hold 4 books, he will need 36 books / 4 books per shelf = 9 shelves.\n\nFor the third question, to find out how many pictures were in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. So, if Olivia uploaded 40 pictures and sorted them into 8 albums, each album has 40 pictures / 8 albums = 5 pictures.\n\nFor the fourth question, to find out how many extra flowers Katie picked, we need to subtract the number of flowers she used in the bouquets from the total number of flowers she picked. So, if Katie picked 3 tulips and 9 roses, and she only used 10 of them in the bouquets, she picked 3 tulips + 9 roses - 10 = 13 extra flowers.", 'true_answer': [2.0]}

Therefore, Oliver will need 9 shelves to store all the books.\nTherefore, the answer is (9).\n\nQ:  Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 8 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of pictures Olivia uploaded by adding the pictures from her phone and camera. She uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera, so 5 + 35 = 40 pictures in total. Next, since the pictures are sorted into 8 different albums with the same number of pictures in each album, divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. Therefore, 40 pictures divided by 8 albums equals 5 pictures per album.\nTherefore, the answer is (5).\n\nQ:  Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera to facebook.

To find out how many customers did leave a tip, we can subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers: 49 - 34 = 15 customers who left a tip.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (15).", 'true_answer': [15.0]}

Since each shelf can hold 4 books, Oliver will need 36 √∑ 4 = 9 shelves to store all the books.\n\nFor the third question, if Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera to Facebook and sorted them into 8 different albums with the same number of pictures in each album, then the number of pictures in each album is 5 + 35 = 40 pictures in total. Divide this number by 8 albums, and we get 40 √∑ 8 = 5 pictures per album.\n\nFor the fourth question, if Mike answered 3 questions correct in the first half and 5 questions correct in the second half, and each question was worth 3 points, then Mike's final score is 3 + 5 = 8 points.\n\nI hope this helps!

If she sorted the pics into 5 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find the total number of pictures Tiffany uploaded. She uploaded 7 pictures from her phone and 13 from her camera, which totals 7 + 13 = 20 pictures. Next, we know she sorted these pictures into 5 different albums, and each album has the same amount of pictures.

If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nOliver starts with 46 books. A librarian takes 10 books, leaving Oliver with 46 - 10 = 36 books. Each shelf can hold 4 books. To find out how many shelves are needed, divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold: 36 divided by 4 equals 9.

I'm here to help you with any more questions you have.\n\nFor the next question, let's break it down step by step:\n\nA new building needed 10 windows. The builder had already installed 6 of them. If it takes 5 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?\n\nFirst, let's find out how many windows are left to install. We know the building needed 10 windows, and the builder has already installed 6, so the remaining windows are 10 - 6 = 4 windows.\n\nNext, we can find out how long it will take the builder to install the remaining windows by multiplying the number of windows by the time it takes to install each window: 4 windows x 5 hours per window = 20 hours.\n\nTherefore, it will take the builder 20 hours to install the rest of the windows. The answer is (20 hours).", 'true_answer': [20.0]}

If she sorted the pics into 5 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find the total number of pictures Tiffany uploaded. She uploaded 7 pictures from her phone and 13 from her camera, which totals 7 + 13 = 20 pictures. Next, we know she sorted these pictures into 5 different albums, and each album has the same amount of pictures.

If she sorted the pics into 8 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of pictures Olivia uploaded by adding the pictures from her phone and her camera. This is 5 (from phone) + 35 (from camera) = 40 pictures in total. Next, we are told that these pictures are evenly distributed into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. So, 40 pictures √∑ 8 albums = 5 pictures per album.\nTherefore, the answer is (5).\n\nQuestion:  A chef needs to cook 15 potatoes. He has already cooked 8.

He has already cooked 8. If each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to cook the rest?\nA: Great question! Let's think step by step. The chef has already cooked 8 potatoes, which means he has 7 more potatoes to cook. Each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, so to find out how long it will take him to cook the remaining 7 potatoes, we multiply the number of potatoes by the time it takes to cook each one: 7 potatoes x 9 minutes per potato = 63 minutes. Therefore, it will take the chef 63 minutes to cook the remaining potatoes. ü•îüï∞Ô∏è\n\nQ: Oliver is at the library helping put away books.

If it takes 8 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?\n\nFirst, let's find out how many windows are left to install. We know the total number of windows needed is 11, and the builder has already installed 4, so the number of windows left to install is 11 - 4 = 7 windows.\n\nNext, we know it takes 8 hours to install each window, so to find out how long it will take the builder to install the remaining 7 windows, we divide the number of windows by the time it takes to install each window: 7 windows √∑ 8 hours per window = 9 hours.\n\nTherefore, it will take the builder 9 hours to install the rest of the windows. The answer is (9).", 'true_answer': [56.0]}

Let's see... Oliver starts with 46 books, and a librarian takes 10 of them, leaving him with 46 - 10 = 36 books. Since he can fit 4 books on a shelf, we can divide the total number of books by the number of books he can fit on a shelf: 36 books √∑ 4 books per shelf = 9 shelves. So, Oliver will need 9 shelves to store all the books. üìö\n\nQ: Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera to Facebook. If she sorted the pics into 8 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums?\nA: Great, let's do the math! Olivia uploaded a total of 5 + 35 = 40 pictures. Since she sorted them into 8 different albums with the same number of pictures in each album, we can divide the total number of pictures by 8: 40 pictures √∑ 8 albums = 5 pictures per album. So, there are 5 pictures in each album. üì∏\n\nQ: In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 7 points. If a level has 11 enemies total and you destroy all but 8 of them, how many points would you earn?\nA: Excellent question! Let's see... if you defeat all but 8 enemies in a level with 11 enemies total, you would have defeated 8 enemies out of 11. So, you would earn 7 points for each of the 8 enemies you defeated, which is 7 x 8 = 56 points. üïπÔ∏è\n\nI hope these answers help you in your adventures! üòä", 'true_answer': [21.0]}
