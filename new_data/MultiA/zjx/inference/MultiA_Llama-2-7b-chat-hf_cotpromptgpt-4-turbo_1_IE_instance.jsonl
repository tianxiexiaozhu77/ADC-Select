You are absolutely right, if only 5 customers bought food, the store would not have any extra bags. Well done!\n\nNow, let's move on to the second question. To find out how many cats the pet store has left, we need to subtract the number of cats sold during the sale from the total number of cats they had initially.\n\nSo, if the pet store had 41 Siamese cats and 28 house cats initially, and they sold 15 cats during the sale, then the total number of cats they have left is:\n\n41 Siamese cats + 28 house cats = 70 cats\n\nSubtracting the 15 cats sold during the sale:\n\n70 cats - 15 cats = 55 cats\n\nTherefore, the pet store has 55 cats left.

{'question': ' A pet store had 15 siamese cats and 49 house cats. During a sale they sold 19 cats. How many cats do they have left? ', 'idx': 85, 'prompt': "Q: A pet store purchased 30 bags of dog food and 15 bags of cat food for a big sale. If only 5 customers bought food, how many extra bags did the store end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe pet store initially purchased 30 bags of dog food and 15 bags of cat food, making a total of 45 bags. With only 5 customers purchasing food, the average number of bags per customer would be 45 bags divided by 5 customers, which equals 9 bags per customer. To calculate the extra bags, we need to know how many bags each customer bought, which is not supplied in the problem. It might be assumed that all customers collectively bought all the bags if no extra bags are mentioned explicitly. Therefore, the store may not have ended up with any extra bags.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQuestion:  A pet store had 15 siamese cats and 49 house cats. During a sale they sold 19 cats.

You are absolutely right, if only 5 customers bought food, the store would not have any extra bags. Well done!\n\nNow, let's move on to the second question.

If only 4 people showed interest, how many extra books did the library end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of books ordered by the library. This is done by adding the number of new books and old books ordered: 57 (new books) + 45 (old books) = 102 books in total. Next, divide this number by the number of people who showed interest to determine how many books each person would need if they were to distribute evenly: 102 books / 4 people = 25.5 books per person. Since it's unlikely the books were cut in half and given out, we assume each person gets 25 books, meaning 4 * 25 = 100 books are distributed. Therefore, the library ends up with 102 total ordered - 100 distributed = 2 extra books.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQuestion:  A book store had 41 books in the bargin bin.

If a shelf in his cupboard can hold only 11 cups, how many shelves will he fill up?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of cups Bob has, which is 40 large cups plus 24 small cups, equaling 64 cups. Next, given that one shelf can hold up to 11 cups, we divide the total number of cups (64) by the number of cups per shelf (11).

I'm so glad you're here to help with these math problems, human! *chomps on some grass*\n\nOkay, let's get started! For the second question, we need to use the same method as before. We have 4 regular sodas and 52 diet sodas, which means we have a total of 56 sodas (4 + 52). Now, we know that each shelf in Tom's fridge can hold up to 7 sodas, so we need to divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas per shelf.\n\n56 / 7 = 8\n\nSo, Tom will fill up 8 shelves in his fridge with soda! *burps* I hope he has enough room for all those drinks! *chews on some more grass*", 'true_answer': [8.0]}

The owner started with 18 puzzles and had 11 left at the end of the day, so the number of puzzles sold is 18 - 11 = 7 puzzles. Next, since each puzzle was sold for 6 dollars, we multiply the number of puzzles sold by the price per puzzle to find the total earnings. That is 7 puzzles * 6 dollars/puzzle = 42 dollars. Therefore, the owner earned a total of 42 dollars by selling the puzzles.\nTherefore, the answer is (42)\n\nQuestion:  A magician was selling magic card decks for 9 dollars each.

Calculate the total amount of money Tom made on Tuesday by multiplying the number of hours he worked (4) by his hourly wage (9 dollars): 4 x 9 = 36 dollars.\n2. Next, do the same calculation for Wednesday where he worked 7 hours, giving 7 x 9 = 63 dollars.\n3.

If 150 meals have already been prepared, how much longer will it take to prepare the remaining meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe chef needs to prepare 200 meals and each meal takes 0.5 hours to prepare. Out of these, 150 meals have already been prepared. To find out the time required to prepare the remaining meals, first find the number of meals left by subtracting the number of meals already made from the total meals needed. The calculation is 200 - 150 = 50 meals left to prepare. Since each meal takes 0.5 hours, the total time needed for 50 meals is 50 meals * 0.5 hours/meal = 25 hours.

She has 53 old photos and she took 5 new ones, so 53 + 5 = 58 photos in total. Each album page can hold 6 photos, so to find the number of pages she used, divide the total number of photos by the number of photos each page can hold. Calculate 58 / 6 = 9.67. Since she can't use a fraction of a page, round up to the next whole number, which is 10. Therefore, Sarah used 10 full pages to hold all her photos.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQuestion:  Haley uploaded 65 pictures to Facebook.

After taking 5 new photos and having 53 old photos, how many album pages did she use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of photos Sarah has by adding her old photos and new photos. She has 53 old photos and she took 5 new ones, so 53 + 5 = 58 photos in total. Each album page can hold 6 photos, so to find the number of pages she used, divide the total number of photos by the number of photos each page can hold. Calculate 58 / 6 = 9.67. Since she can't use a fraction of a page, round up to the next whole number, which is 10. Therefore, Sarah used 10 full pages to hold all her photos.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQuestion:  Nancy uploaded 51 pictures to Facebook.

How many full trays can she still line up?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst we'll calculate how many cupcakes Sarah had left after dropping some. She originally had 102 cupcakes and dropped some leaving her with 90 cupcakes. Next, we need to figure out how many full trays of 6 cupcakes each she can still line up with the 90 cupcakes left. To do this, divide the number of cupcakes she has left by the number of cupcakes that can fit in a tray. So, 90 cupcakes divided by 6 cupcakes per tray equals 15 trays.

After taking 5 new photos and having 53 old photos, how many album pages did she use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of photos Sarah has by adding her old photos and new photos. She has 53 old photos and she took 5 new ones, so 53 + 5 = 58 photos in total. Each album page can hold 6 photos, so to find the number of pages she used, divide the total number of photos by the number of photos each page can hold. Calculate 58 / 6 = 9.67. Since she can't use a fraction of a page, round up to the next whole number, which is 10.
