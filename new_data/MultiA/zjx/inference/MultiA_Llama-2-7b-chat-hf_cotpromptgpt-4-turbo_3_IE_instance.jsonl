If she solved 70 of these problems at school, how many problems did she need to complete later at home?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmily had a total of 65 algebra equations and 15 geometry problems, making it 80 problems altogether. She solved 70 of these problems at school. So, the number of problems left for her to complete at home would be the total problems minus the problems she already solved: 80 - 70 = 10. However, reevaluating the initial problem statement, Emily actually had a total of 80 problems and she solved 70 of them at school, so she would have 80 - 70 = 10 problems to finish at home. But, if we consider that she solved 70 out of these 80, it implies that if there's no indication of any issue or special context (such as problems having to be revised or redone), then it can be deduced that she completed all necessary work within the 70 problems she addressed at school, assuming each problem was solved correctly and to completion.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: Anna had 40 literature review questions and 20 thesis statement questions for her coursework.

If only 30 customers wanted cages or tanks, how many extra did the pet store end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of cages and tanks the pet store received. This is done by adding the bird cages and fish tanks received: 18 bird cages + 22 fish tanks = 40 total cages/tanks. Then, compare this total with the number of customers who wanted cages or tanks, which is 30. The difference between the total cages/tanks and the number of interested customers gives the number of extra cages/tanks: 40 total cages/tanks - 30 customers = 10 extra cages/tanks.

', 'idx': 81, 'prompt': "Q: A florist prepared 40 bouquets of roses and 55 bouquets of tulips for a wedding, but only 70 bouquets were used, how many extra bouquets did they end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of bouquets prepared by adding the number of rose bouquets and tulip bouquets. This gives us 40 bouquets of roses plus 55 bouquets of tulips equals 95 bouquets in total. Next, determine how many bouquets were used, which is given as 70 bouquets. To find out how many extra bouquets there were, subtract the number of bouquets used from the total number of bouquets prepared.

Next, consider that each bouquet purchased represents a combination of roses and tulips. If 125 bouquets were sold and assuming a worst-case scenario each bouquet used at least 1 flower, 125 flowers in total would be used. If each bouquet used at least 3 flowers, 375 flowers would be used, which exceeds the total prepared, leading to zero extra flowers with a practical bouquet composition. It's safe to assume that each bouquet uses at least 2 to 3 flowers and thus all 350 flowers would adequately be accounted for in 125 bouquets.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: A nursery purchased 90 roses and 70 tulips for a special event.

The nursery bought 90 roses and 70 tulips, which sums up to 90 + 70 = 160 flowers. Next, we determine how many flowers were needed for the 140 guests; each guest wanted one flower, so 140 flowers were needed. Lastly, we calculate the difference between the total number of flowers bought and the number needed. This is 160 - 140 = 20. Hence, the nursery ended up with 20 extra flowers.\nTherefore, the answer is (20)\n\nQuestion:  Bianca picked 39 tulips and 49 roses to make flower bouquets.

If only 4 people showed interest, how many extra books did the library end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of books ordered by the library. This is done by adding the number of new books and old books ordered: 57 (new books) + 45 (old books) = 102 books in total. Next, divide this number by the number of people who showed interest to determine how many books each person would need if they were to distribute evenly: 102 books / 4 people = 25.5 books per person. Since it's unlikely the books were cut in half and given out, we assume each person gets 25 books, meaning 4 * 25 = 100 books are distributed.

But then, it received 10 more books, so now it has 75 + 10 = 85 books on the shelf. 📚\n\nFor the third question, let's see... if the library ordered 57 new books and 45 old books, and only 4 people showed interest, then the library ends up with 57 + 45 = 102 books in total. If each person gets 25 books, then the library has 102 - 25 = 77 books left. But then, it puts 2 more books in the bin, so the answer is 77 + 2 = 79 books in the bin. 📚\n\nFor the fourth question, let's calculate... if the bookstore had 41 books in the bargain bin and sold 33 of them, then it has 41 - 33 = 8 books left in the bin.

How many extra flowers did the shop end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, sum the total flowers prepared by the shop: 200 roses + 150 tulips = 350 flowers. Next, consider that each bouquet purchased represents a combination of roses and tulips. If 125 bouquets were sold and assuming a worst-case scenario each bouquet used at least 1 flower, 125 flowers in total would be used. If each bouquet used at least 3 flowers, 375 flowers would be used, which exceeds the total prepared, leading to zero extra flowers with a practical bouquet composition. It's safe to assume that each bouquet uses at least 2 to 3 flowers and thus all 350 flowers would adequately be accounted for in 125 bouquets.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: Emma was planting flowers in her garden and initially planted 20 flowers.

The difference between the total cages/tanks and the number of interested customers gives the number of extra cages/tanks: 40 total cages/tanks - 30 customers = 10 extra cages/tanks. Hence, the pet store ended up with 10 extra cages or tanks.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQuestion:  A pet store has 4 bird cages.

So, the total number of trays Dave needs to pick up is 17 + 55 = 72 trays.\n\nNow, we can divide the total number of trays by the number of trays Dave can carry per trip to find out how many trips he will make. If Dave can carry 9 trays per trip, then we can divide 72 trays by 9 to get the answer:\n\n72 trays ÷ 9 trays per trip = 8 trips\n\nTherefore, Dave will make 8 trips to pick up all the lunch trays. 😊", 'true_answer': [8.0]}
{'question': ' For a birthday party George bought 10 regular sodas and 22 diet sodas. If his fridge would only hold 4 on each shelf, how many shelves would he fill up? ', 'idx': 330, 'prompt': "Q: During a family reunion, Tom purchased 50 cans of cola and 30 cans of lemonade. If his storage rack holds 12 on each shelf, how many shelves would he need?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of cans by adding the cola and lemonade cans. This results in 50 cola cans + 30 lemonade cans = 80 cans total. Next, determine the number of shelves needed by dividing the total number of cans by the capacity of each shelf (12 cans per shelf). So, 80 cans divided by 12 equals about 6.67. Since you can't have a fraction of a shelf in practical scenarios, you round up to 7 shelves to fit all the cans.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: During a sports meet, Chris got 72 energy bars and 48 water bottles.

Emily solved 32 problems, and her group mates solved 16 problems, so the total number of problems solved is 32 + 16 = 48. Dividing the total number of problems solved by 8 gives us 48 / 8 = 6 points. Therefore, the answer is (6). 🤔\n\nFor the third question, you asked how many points you would obtain if you answered 8 questions correctly in a board game where each question is worth 3 points. To find the total points, we need to multiply the number of correctly answered questions by the points per question. In this case, we have 8 correctly answered questions, so we multiply them by 3 points per question to get 24 points. Therefore, the answer is (24). 🎮\n\nFor the fourth question, you asked how many points you would earn if you defeated 11 enemies in a video game where each enemy defeated gives you 9 points. To find the total points, we need to multiply the number of enemies defeated by the points per enemy. In this case, we have defeated 11 enemies, so we multiply them by 9 points per enemy to get 99 points. Therefore, the answer is (99). 🔥\n\nI hope that helps!

', 'idx': 414, 'prompt': "Q: Alex was setting up his video game collection with exactly 7 games per shelf. If he had 8 shelves of adventure games and 2 shelves of puzzle games, how many games did he have altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of games on the shelves dedicated to adventure games. With 7 games per shelf and 8 shelves, the calculation is 7 games x 8 shelves = 56 games for adventure. Next, compute the total number of games on the shelves dedicated to puzzle games. Again, with 7 games per shelf and 2 shelves, the calculation comes to 7 games x 2 shelves = 14 games for puzzle.

', 'idx': 462, 'prompt': "Q: In a cafe each adult coffee costs $5 and children's hot chocolate is free. If a group of 10 people visited and 7 were children, how much would it cost for the group to have their drinks?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, evaluate the number of adults in the group, which is 10 total people minus 7 children, giving 3 adults. Each adult coffee is $5. So, the total cost for the adult coffees is 3 adults times $5 each, which equals $15. Since children's hot chocolate is free, there is no additional cost for the 7 children's drinks. Adding the costs together, the total cost for the group’s drinks is just for the adult coffees which is $15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: At a diner each adult burger costs $8 while a kid's meal is free. If a party of 15 comes in and 10 are kids, what would be the total cost for the party to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total cost of the meals for the party, we need to determine the number of adults and children. The problem states that there are 15 people in total and 10 of them are kids. The number of adults is 15 - 10 = 5. Each adult burger costs $8, so the cost for the adult burgers is 5 adults x $8/adult = $40. Since kid's meals are free, there is no cost associated with the 10 kids' meals. Adding the costs gives us a total cost of $40 for the adults' meals only, as the kids' meals are free.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: In a fast food joint, each burger costs $4 and fries come free. If a party of 15 people entered and 9 were kids who ate fries, how much would it cost for the party?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, identify the number of people who consumed burgers. Since 9 kids ate only fries and there were 15 people in total, the number of people who ate burgers is 15 - 9 = 6. Each burger costs $4, therefore the total cost for burgers is 6 * $4 = $24. Since fries are free, there are no additional costs for the fries. Hence, the total cost for the party is solely from the burgers which is $24.\nTherefore, the answer is (24)\n\nQuestion:  At a restaurant each adult meal costs $5 and kids eat free.

If it takes 10 minutes to prepare each meal, how long will it take him to prepare the remaining meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the number of remaining meals by subtracting the number of meals already prepared from the total number of meals. The total number of meals is 80 and the chef has already prepared 30 meals. So, the remaining meals to prepare are 80 - 30 = 50.

Out of these, 150 meals have already been prepared. To find out the time required to prepare the remaining meals, first find the number of meals left by subtracting the number of meals already made from the total meals needed. The calculation is 200 - 150 = 50 meals left to prepare. Since each meal takes 0.5 hours, the total time needed for 50 meals is 50 meals * 0.5 hours/meal = 25 hours. Therefore, it will take 25 more hours to prepare the remaining meals.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQuestion:  A chef needs to cook 13 potatoes. He has already cooked 5.

If he created 20 different photo albums with the same number of photos in each album, how many photos were in each album?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we find the total number of photos Tom shot: 130 photos with his DSLR plus 70 photos with his smartphone, which sum up to 200 photos in total. Then, since he created 20 different photo albums and each album has the same number of photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of albums. Therefore, 200 total photos divided by 20 albums equals 10 photos per album.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Sarah was placing her photographs in an album with 6 photos on each page. After taking 5 new photos and having 53 old photos, how many album pages did she use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of photos Sarah has by adding her old photos and new photos. She has 53 old photos and she took 5 new ones, so 53 + 5 = 58 photos in total. Each album page can hold 6 photos, so to find the number of pages she used, divide the total number of photos by the number of photos each page can hold. Calculate 58 / 6 = 9.67. Since she can't use a fraction of a page, round up to the next whole number, which is 10. Therefore, Sarah used 10 full pages to hold all her photos.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQuestion:  Wendy uploaded 79 pictures to Facebook.

Then, they received an additional delivery of 25 roses. To find the total number of roses after the delivery, we add the initial stock of roses to the roses received in the delivery: 50 roses + 25 roses = 75 roses. Next, we need to determine how many bouquets can be made if each bouquet consists of 5 roses.

If 50 of them canceled their registration and the remaining were divided into 10 groups, how many kids would be in each group?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there are 120 kids signed up for the camp. Since 50 kids canceled, we subtract 50 from 120 to find the number of kids left: 120 - 50 = 70. These remaining 70 kids are then divided into 10 groups. To find the number of kids per group, we divide the number of kids left by the number of groups: 70 / 10 = 7. Each group would therefore consist of 7 kids.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQuestion:  There are 58 students trying out for the school's trivia teams.

She purchased 12 brushes from a friend and 26 more at an art fair. If 9 of the brushes were frayed, how many usable brushes did she gather?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst calculate the total number of brushes Amy purchased by adding the brushes bought from a friend and those bought at the art fair: 12 brushes from a friend + 26 brushes from the art fair = 38 brushes total. Next, account for the unusable brushes. Since 9 of the brushes are frayed and unusable, subtract these from the total number of brushes: 38 total brushes - 9 frayed brushes = 29 usable brushes.

If one row in the garden can hold 11 flowers, how many rows will Emily need?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially Emily had 60 flowers to plant. Her friend planted 5 of them which leaves Emily with 60 - 5 = 55 flowers to plant. If one row in the garden can hold 11 flowers, then the number of rows Emily will need to plant all her flowers is 55 divided by 11. This equals 55 / 11 = 5.

If decorating the hall requires 10 roses per decoration, how many decorations could she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the number of roses used in the bouquets. If each bouquet contains 20 roses and the gardener made bouquets with these, we get: 120 / 20 = 6 bouquets, using up 6 * 20 = 120 roses. Since all 120 roses are used in the bouquets, there are no remaining roses to use for decorations. Therefore, the number of decorations the gardener can make with the remaining roses is zero because there are no leftover roses.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQuestion:  Paige picked 53 flowers for her friend’s wedding.

{'question': ' Sarah was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 21 seeds and planted 12 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 3 seeds each. How many small gardens did Sarah have? ', 'idx': 578, 'prompt': "Q: Sarah planted 300 seeds. She noticed that 180 have sprouted and she has 4 plots left with seeds. If each plot has the same number of seeds, how many seeds are in each plot?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirstly, Sarah planted a total of 300 seeds. But so far, 180 of the seeds have already sprouted, leaving the seeds that haven't sprouted yet. To find the number of seeds that haven't sprouted, subtract the number of sprouted seeds from the total seeds planted, which is 300 - 180 = 120. Sarah has 4 plots with the remaining unsprouted seeds. To find the number of seeds per plot, divide the unsprouted seeds by the number of plots, so 120 seeds / 4 plots = 30 seeds per plot. Therefore, each of the 4 plots has 30 seeds in them.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\nQ: Linda wanted to grow her plant nursery.

In one day they sold 24 of them and put the rest into cages with 4 in each cage. How many cages did they use?\n\nAww, that's a great question! 🐶 To find out how many cages the pet store used, we need to subtract the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies they had. So, if they had 56 puppies and sold 24 of them, that means they have 56 - 24 = 32 puppies left. And since each cage can hold 4 puppies, they will need 32 / 4 = 8 cages to hold all the remaining puppies. So, the pet store used 8 cages. 🐾\n\nTherefore, the answer is (8) cages. 😊", 'true_answer': [8.0]}
