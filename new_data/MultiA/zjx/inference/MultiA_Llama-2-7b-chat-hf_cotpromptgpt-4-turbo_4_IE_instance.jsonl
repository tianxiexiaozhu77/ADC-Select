If she solved 70 of these problems at school, how many problems did she need to complete later at home?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmily had a total of 65 algebra equations and 15 geometry problems, making it 80 problems altogether. She solved 70 of these problems at school. So, the number of problems left for her to complete at home would be the total problems minus the problems she already solved: 80 - 70 = 10. However, reevaluating the initial problem statement, Emily actually had a total of 80 problems and she solved 70 of them at school, so she would have 80 - 70 = 10 problems to finish at home. But, if we consider that she solved 70 out of these 80, it implies that if there's no indication of any issue or special context (such as problems having to be revised or redone), then it can be deduced that she completed all necessary work within the 70 problems she addressed at school, assuming each problem was solved correctly and to completion.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: John had 60 English questions and 15 history questions for his assignment.

To calculate the extra bags, we need to know how many bags each customer bought, which is not supplied in the problem. It might be assumed that all customers collectively bought all the bags if no extra bags are mentioned explicitly. Therefore, the store may not have ended up with any extra bags.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQuestion:  A pet store had 41 siamese cats and 28 house cats. During a sale they sold 15 cats.

Mia dug up 35 potatoes and her aunt dug up 20 potatoes. Adding these quantities gives us a total of 55 potatoes (35 + 20 = 55). We are told that only 40 of these potatoes were of good quality. To find out how many poor quality potatoes they had, we subtract the number of good quality potatoes from the total number of potatoes. This calculation is 55 - 40 = 15, meaning they had 15 poor quality potatoes.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: Emma and her cousin were picking oranges from their grove.

She solved 70 of these problems at school. So, the number of problems left for her to complete at home would be the total problems minus the problems she already solved: 80 - 70 = 10. However, reevaluating the initial problem statement, Emily actually had a total of 80 problems and she solved 70 of them at school, so she would have 80 - 70 = 10 problems to finish at home. But, if we consider that she solved 70 out of these 80, it implies that if there's no indication of any issue or special context (such as problems having to be revised or redone), then it can be deduced that she completed all necessary work within the 70 problems she addressed at school, assuming each problem was solved correctly and to completion.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: Tim had to solve 40 math problems and 60 science problems for his homework.

If he sold 17 of them and used the money he earned to buy 7 new books, how many books would Kaleb have?\n\nAnswer: Let's first calculate the number of books Kaleb sold. He sold 17 books, so the number of books he has left is 34 - 17 = 17 books.\n\nNext, we can calculate the number of new books Kaleb bought by adding the amount of money he earned from selling the books to the total number of books he had. If he earned $X from selling the 17 books, and he had 17 books initially, then the amount of money he earned per book is $X / 17 = $X / 34.\n\nNow, we can use the amount of money Kaleb earned to buy new books. If he earned $X from selling the 17 books, then he can use that amount to buy 7 new books, which is equal to $X / 34 x 7 = $X / 241.\n\nTherefore, Kaleb has 17 books left, and he bought 7 new books using the money he earned from selling the other books, so the final answer is (17 + 7) = 24 books.", 'true_answer': [24.0]}

Without details on the sale transactions or the distribution of the plants to the gardeners, it is impossible to determine how many plants, if any, were left unsold.

How many extra flowers did the shop end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, sum the total flowers prepared by the shop: 200 roses + 150 tulips = 350 flowers. Next, consider that each bouquet purchased represents a combination of roses and tulips. If 125 bouquets were sold and assuming a worst-case scenario each bouquet used at least 1 flower, 125 flowers in total would be used. If each bouquet used at least 3 flowers, 375 flowers would be used, which exceeds the total prepared, leading to zero extra flowers with a practical bouquet composition. It's safe to assume that each bouquet uses at least 2 to 3 flowers and thus all 350 flowers would adequately be accounted for in 125 bouquets.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: A nursery purchased 90 roses and 70 tulips for a special event.

The problem states that the florist arranged 40 roses and 60 tulips, so the total number of flowers is 40 + 60 = 100 flowers.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of flowers used in the decoration from the total number of flowers prepared. In this case, the problem states that 70 flowers were used in the decoration, so we subtract 70 from 100: 100 - 70 = 30 extra flowers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (30).\n\nFor the second question, we need to calculate the total number of plants the gardening center stocked. The problem states that the center stocked 48 rose bushes and 36 tulip bulbs, so the total number of plants is 48 + 36 = 84 plants.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many plants were not sold. The problem does not provide any information on how many plants were sold, so we can assume that all 84 plants were sold. Therefore, there were no extra plants left unsold.\n\nSo, the answer is (0).\n\nFor the third question, we need to calculate the total number of flowers prepared by the flower shop. The problem states that the shop prepared 200 roses and 150 tulips, so the total number of flowers is 200 + 150 = 350 flowers.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many flowers were used in the bouquets. The problem states that only 125 bouquets were purchased, so we can calculate the number of flowers used in each bouquet by dividing the total number of flowers by the number of bouquets: 350 flowers / 125 bouquets = 2.8 flowers per bouquet (round down to 2 flowers per bouquet).\n\nSince each bouquet uses at least 2 flowers, we can conclude that all 350 flowers were accounted for in the 125 bouquets. Therefore, there are no extra flowers left over.\n\nSo, the answer is (0).\n\nFor the fourth question, we need to calculate the total number of flowers the nursery purchased. The problem states that the nursery bought 90 roses and 70 tulips, so the total number of flowers is 90 + 70 = 160 flowers.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many flowers were needed for the 140 guests. Since each guest wanted one flower, we need 140 flowers in total.\n\nLastly, we calculate the difference between the total number of flowers bought and the number needed: 160 - 140 = 20 extra flowers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (20).\n\nFor the final question, we need to calculate the total number of roses the florist had initially.

Then, they received 10 more books, making the total number of books on the shelf 75 + 10 = 85.\nTherefore, the answer is (85)\n\nQ: A library ordered 57 copies of a new book and 45 copies of an old book for a local book club. If only 4 people showed interest, how many extra books did the library end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of books ordered by the library. This is done by adding the number of new books and old books ordered: 57 (new books) + 45 (old books) = 102 books in total. Next, divide this number by the number of people who showed interest to determine how many books each person would need if they were to distribute evenly: 102 books / 4 people = 25.5 books per person. Since it's unlikely the books were cut in half and given out, we assume each person gets 25 books, meaning 4 * 25 = 100 books are distributed. Therefore, the library ends up with 102 total ordered - 100 distributed = 2 extra books.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQuestion:  A book store had 41 books in the bargin bin. If they sold 33 books, but then put 2 more in the bin, how many books would be in the bin? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': " Of course, I'd be happy to help you with that! üêÆ\n\nFor the first question, we need to calculate the total number of books Sam acquired. He got 35 books from a bookstore and 15 from a flea market, so the total number of books is 35 + 15 = 50 books. Then, we're told that 40 of these books were damaged, so we subtract the damaged books from the total number of books to find the number of good books: 50 - 40 = 10 good books. Therefore, the answer is (10).\n\nFor the second question, we need to calculate the total number of books ordered by the library. The library ordered 50 mystery books and 35 science fiction books, so the total number of books ordered is 50 + 35 = 85 books. Then, we're told that only 60 attendees wanted books, so we subtract the number of attendees from the total number of books to find the number of extra books: 85 - 60 = 25 extra books. Therefore, the answer is (25).\n\nFor the third question, we need to calculate the number of books on the shelf initially. The library had 120 books on the shelf, so the answer is (120).\n\nFor the fourth question, we need to calculate the total number of books ordered by the library. The library ordered 57 copies of a new book and 45 copies of an old book, so the total number of books is 57 + 45 = 102 books. Then, we're told that only 4 people showed interest, so we divide the total number of books by the number of people to find the number of books each person would need: 102 books / 4 people = 25.5 books per person. Since it's unlikely the books were cut in half and given out, we assume each person gets 25 books, meaning 4 * 25 = 100 books are distributed. Therefore, the answer is (100).\n\nFor the fifth question, we need to calculate the number of books in the bargain bin initially. The bookstore had 41 books in the bargain bin, so the answer is (41).\n\nThen, we're told that the bookstore sold 33 books, so the number of books in the bargain bin after the sale is 41 - 33 = 8 books. Finally, we're given that 2 more books were put in the bin, so the total number of books in the bargain bin is 8 + 2 = 10 books. Therefore, the answer is (10).", 'true_answer': [10.0]}

Next, consider that each bouquet purchased represents a combination of roses and tulips. If 125 bouquets were sold and assuming a worst-case scenario each bouquet used at least 1 flower, 125 flowers in total would be used. If each bouquet used at least 3 flowers, 375 flowers would be used, which exceeds the total prepared, leading to zero extra flowers with a practical bouquet composition. It's safe to assume that each bouquet uses at least 2 to 3 flowers and thus all 350 flowers would adequately be accounted for in 125 bouquets.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: A gardening center stocked 48 rose bushes and 36 tulip bulbs for a spring garden sale.

{'question': ' A florist had 11 roses. If she sold 2 of them and then later picked 32 more, how many roses would she have? ', 'idx': 177, 'prompt': "Q: A florist had 87 flowers in a shop. If they sold 40 flowers, but then received 11 new flowers, how many flowers would be in the shop?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the remaining flowers after sales by subtracting the number of flowers sold from the initial amount. Initially, there were 87 flowers and 40 were sold, so 87 - 40 = 47 flowers remained. Then, the florist received 11 new flowers, so add these to the remaining flowers to find the total.

The nursery bought 90 roses and 70 tulips, which sums up to 90 + 70 = 160 flowers. Next, we determine how many flowers were needed for the 140 guests; each guest wanted one flower, so 140 flowers were needed.

It's safe to assume that each bouquet uses at least 2 to 3 flowers and thus all 350 flowers would adequately be accounted for in 125 bouquets.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: A nursery purchased 90 roses and 70 tulips for a special event. But, if only 140 guests wanted flowers, how many extra did the nursery end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of flowers purchased by the nursery. The nursery bought 90 roses and 70 tulips, which sums up to 90 + 70 = 160 flowers. Next, we determine how many flowers were needed for the 140 guests; each guest wanted one flower, so 140 flowers were needed. Lastly, we calculate the difference between the total number of flowers bought and the number needed. This is 160 - 140 = 20. Hence, the nursery ended up with 20 extra flowers.\nTherefore, the answer is (20)\n\nQ: Emma was planting flowers in her garden and initially planted 20 flowers. She noticed that 5 flowers withered.

Each cage holds 4 lions and 3 tigers, so adding them together gives 4 + 3 = 7 animals per cage. Since there are 5 cages, the total number of animals across all cages would be 7 animals per cage multiplied by 5 cages, which is 7 * 5 = 35.

', 'idx': 330, 'prompt': "Q: During a family reunion, Tom purchased 50 cans of cola and 30 cans of lemonade. If his storage rack holds 12 on each shelf, how many shelves would he need?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of cans by adding the cola and lemonade cans. This results in 50 cola cans + 30 lemonade cans = 80 cans total. Next, determine the number of shelves needed by dividing the total number of cans by the capacity of each shelf (12 cans per shelf). So, 80 cans divided by 12 equals about 6.67. Since you can't have a fraction of a shelf in practical scenarios, you round up to 7 shelves to fit all the cans.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: During a company event, Bob got 15 cans of cola and 35 bottles of sparkling water. If each cooler can store 10 bottles, how many coolers are needed to store them all?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of drink containers Bob got: 15 cans of cola + 35 bottles of sparkling water = 50 containers. Each cooler can store 10 bottles. We need to figure out how many coolers are needed to store all 50 containers. To find this, we divide the total number of containers by the number of containers each cooler can hold: 50 / 10 = 5.

To find out how many minivans are needed, divide the total number of people by the capacity of one minivan. 23 divided by 7 is approximately 3.29, which means they would need at least 4 minivans to transport everyone because a minivan cannot transport a fraction of a person.\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQ: Ben was helping at the community center set up for an event, but he could only carry 8 chairs at a time. If he had to set up 64 chairs in the auditorium and 16 in the meeting room, how many trips will he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nBen can carry 8 chairs in one trip. To find out the number of trips he needs for the auditorium, we divide the total number of chairs for the auditorium, 64, by the number of chairs Ben can carry at one time, 8. 64 divided by 8 is 8. For the meeting room, he needs to set up 16 chairs. Similarly, dividing 16 by 8 gives 2 trips. Adding both results, 8 trips for the auditorium and 2 trips for the meeting room, Ben will make a total of 10 trips.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: The book club is planning a trip to the library.

Each adult plate costs $6, hence, the total cost for all adult plates is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per plate, which is 8 * $6 = $48. Since salads are free for kids, there is no additional cost for the 12 kids. Thus, the total cost for the group to eat is simply the cost of the adult plates.\nTherefore, the answer is (48)\n\nQuestion:  At a restaurant each adult meal costs $3 and kids eat free.

If a group of 20 people came in and 12 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, determine the number of adults and children in the group from the total of 20 people, with 12 being kids, it follows that there are 8 adults. Each adult plate costs $6, hence, the total cost for all adult plates is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per plate, which is 8 * $6 = $48. Since salads are free for kids, there is no additional cost for the 12 kids. Thus, the total cost for the group to eat is simply the cost of the adult plates.\nTherefore, the answer is (48)\n\nQ: In a fast food joint, each burger costs $4 and fries come free. If a party of 15 people entered and 9 were kids who ate fries, how much would it cost for the party?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, identify the number of people who consumed burgers. Since 9 kids ate only fries and there were 15 people in total, the number of people who ate burgers is 15 - 9 = 6. Each burger costs $4, therefore the total cost for burgers is 6 * $4 = $24. Since fries are free, there are no additional costs for the fries. Hence, the total cost for the party is solely from the burgers which is $24.\nTherefore, the answer is (24)\n\nQ: At a buffet, each adult entry fee is $10 and kids under 5 eat free. If a group of 13 people visited and 7 were under the age of 5, what would be the total cost for the group?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are 13 people in total in the group, out of which 7 are under the age of 5 and hence they eat for free. This means there are 13 - 7 = 6 people who are paying the adult entry fee of $10 each. Thus, the total cost for the group would be 6 adults * $10/adult = $60.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQ: In a cafe each adult coffee costs $5 and children's hot chocolate is free. If a group of 10 people visited and 7 were children, how much would it cost for the group to have their drinks?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, evaluate the number of adults in the group, which is 10 total people minus 7 children, giving 3 adults. Each adult coffee is $5. So, the total cost for the adult coffees is 3 adults times $5 each, which equals $15. Since children's hot chocolate is free, there is no additional cost for the 7 children's drinks. Adding the costs together, the total cost for the group‚Äôs drinks is just for the adult coffees which is $15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQuestion:  At a restaurant each adult meal costs $7 and kids eat free.

{'question': ' At a restaurant each adult meal costs $5 and kids eat free. If a group of 15 people came in and 8 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat? ', 'idx': 462, 'prompt': "Q: In a cafe each adult coffee costs $5 and children's hot chocolate is free. If a group of 10 people visited and 7 were children, how much would it cost for the group to have their drinks?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, evaluate the number of adults in the group, which is 10 total people minus 7 children, giving 3 adults. Each adult coffee is $5. So, the total cost for the adult coffees is 3 adults times $5 each, which equals $15. Since children's hot chocolate is free, there is no additional cost for the 7 children's drinks. Adding the costs together, the total cost for the group‚Äôs drinks is just for the adult coffees which is $15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: In a cafeteria, each adult plate costs $6 and salad is free for kids. If a group of 20 people came in and 12 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, determine the number of adults and children in the group from the total of 20 people, with 12 being kids, it follows that there are 8 adults. Each adult plate costs $6, hence, the total cost for all adult plates is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per plate, which is 8 * $6 = $48. Since salads are free for kids, there is no additional cost for the 12 kids. Thus, the total cost for the group to eat is simply the cost of the adult plates.\nTherefore, the answer is (48)\n\nQ: At a diner each adult burger costs $8 while a kid's meal is free. If a party of 15 comes in and 10 are kids, what would be the total cost for the party to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total cost of the meals for the party, we need to determine the number of adults and children. The problem states that there are 15 people in total and 10 of them are kids. The number of adults is 15 - 10 = 5. Each adult burger costs $8, so the cost for the adult burgers is 5 adults x $8/adult = $40. Since kid's meals are free, there is no cost associated with the 10 kids' meals. Adding the costs gives us a total cost of $40 for the adults' meals only, as the kids' meals are free.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: In a fast food joint, each burger costs $4 and fries come free. If a party of 15 people entered and 9 were kids who ate fries, how much would it cost for the party?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, identify the number of people who consumed burgers. Since 9 kids ate only fries and there were 15 people in total, the number of people who ate burgers is 15 - 9 = 6. Each burger costs $4, therefore the total cost for burgers is 6 * $4 = $24. Since fries are free, there are no additional costs for the fries. Hence, the total cost for the party is solely from the burgers which is $24.\nTherefore, the answer is (24)\n\nQuestion:  At a restaurant each adult meal costs $5 and kids eat free.

If she had only baked 15 of them as guests arrived, how many did she not bake?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLaura needed to bake a total of 40 cupcakes and 20 cookies which adds up to 60 treats. If she only managed to bake 15 items as guests arrived, the number of items she did not bake would be the total initial amount minus what she baked by the time the guests arrived.

On the first day, she baked 6 batches, and on the second day, she baked 4 batches. Thus, total batches = 6 + 4 = 10 batches. Next, we find out the total number of cookies by multiplying the number of batches by the number of cookies in each batch.

If a group of 10 people visited and 7 were children, how much would it cost for the group to have their drinks?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, evaluate the number of adults in the group, which is 10 total people minus 7 children, giving 3 adults. Each adult coffee is $5. So, the total cost for the adult coffees is 3 adults times $5 each, which equals $15. Since children's hot chocolate is free, there is no additional cost for the 7 children's drinks. Adding the costs together, the total cost for the group‚Äôs drinks is just for the adult coffees which is $15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: At a diner each adult burger costs $8 while a kid's meal is free. If a party of 15 comes in and 10 are kids, what would be the total cost for the party to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total cost of the meals for the party, we need to determine the number of adults and children. The problem states that there are 15 people in total and 10 of them are kids. The number of adults is 15 - 10 = 5. Each adult burger costs $8, so the cost for the adult burgers is 5 adults x $8/adult = $40. Since kid's meals are free, there is no cost associated with the 10 kids' meals. Adding the costs gives us a total cost of $40 for the adults' meals only, as the kids' meals are free.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: In a cafeteria, each adult plate costs $6 and salad is free for kids.

Each adult plate costs $6, hence, the total cost for all adult plates is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per plate, which is 8 * $6 = $48. Since salads are free for kids, there is no additional cost for the 12 kids.

If a party of 15 people entered and 9 were kids who ate fries, how much would it cost for the party?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, identify the number of people who consumed burgers. Since 9 kids ate only fries and there were 15 people in total, the number of people who ate burgers is 15 - 9 = 6. Each burger costs $4, therefore the total cost for burgers is 6 * $4 = $24. Since fries are free, there are no additional costs for the fries. Hence, the total cost for the party is solely from the burgers which is $24.\nTherefore, the answer is (24)\n\nQuestion:  At a restaurant each adult meal costs $2 and kids eat free.

{'question': ' At a restaurant each adult meal costs $2 and kids eat free. If a group of 9 people came in and 2 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat? ', 'idx': 495, 'prompt': "Q: In a fast food joint, each burger costs $4 and fries come free. If a party of 15 people entered and 9 were kids who ate fries, how much would it cost for the party?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, identify the number of people who consumed burgers. Since 9 kids ate only fries and there were 15 people in total, the number of people who ate burgers is 15 - 9 = 6. Each burger costs $4, therefore the total cost for burgers is 6 * $4 = $24. Since fries are free, there are no additional costs for the fries. Hence, the total cost for the party is solely from the burgers which is $24.\nTherefore, the answer is (24)\n\nQ: At a cafe, each adult coffee costs $3 and children's hot chocolate is free. If a group of 12 people visited and 7 of them were children, how much would it cost for the group to drink?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much it would cost for the group to drink, we need to calculate the total cost of drinks for the adults only, since children's hot chocolate is free. Given that each adult coffee costs $3, we first determine how many adults are in the group. From a total of 12 people, 7 of them are children, so there are 12 - 7 = 5 adults. The total cost for the adults' coffee is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per coffee: 5 adults * $3 per coffee = $15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: In a cafeteria, each adult plate costs $6 and salad is free for kids.

Each adult plate costs $6, hence, the total cost for all adult plates is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per plate, which is 8 * $6 = $48. Since salads are free for kids, there is no additional cost for the 12 kids. Thus, the total cost for the group to eat is simply the cost of the adult plates.\nTherefore, the answer is (48)\n\nQ: In a cafe each adult coffee costs $5 and children's hot chocolate is free.

Each adult coffee is $5. So, the total cost for the adult coffees is 3 adults times $5 each, which equals $15. Since children's hot chocolate is free, there is no additional cost for the 7 children's drinks. Adding the costs together, the total cost for the group‚Äôs drinks is just for the adult coffees which is $15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQuestion:  At a restaurant each adult meal costs $2 and kids eat free.

They arranged the roses in bouquets with 5 roses in each bouquet. How many bouquets did they make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the florist had 50 roses in stock. Then, they received an additional delivery of 25 roses. To find the total number of roses after the delivery, we add the initial stock of roses to the roses received in the delivery: 50 roses + 25 roses = 75 roses. Next, we need to determine how many bouquets can be made if each bouquet consists of 5 roses. To do this, we divide the total number of roses by the number of roses per bouquet: 75 roses / 5 roses per bouquet = 15 bouquets. Thus, the florist can make 15 bouquets with the available roses.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: Amy was excited to update her art supplies.

To determine the number of crates required to store these cans, we divide the remaining number of cans by the capacity of each crate, which is 10 cans per crate. Therefore, the number of crates required is 120 / 10 = 12 crates.\nTherefore, the answer is (12)\n\nQ: At a pet shelter fundraiser, for every 8 bags of dog food donated, sponsors get one free grooming session. If Emily donated 16 bags and her family donated 32 bags, how many grooming sessions did they get?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we find the total number of bags of dog food donated which is the sum of Emily's and her family's donations. Emily donated 16 bags and her family donated 32 bags, giving a total of 16 + 32 = 48 bags. Next, according to the fundraiser rules, for every 8 bags donated, sponsors get one free grooming session. To find the total number of grooming sessions, divide the total number of bags (48) by the number required for a free session (8). This calculation is 48 / 8 = 6. Therefore, they get six grooming sessions.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: A farmer harvested 200 apples from his orchard. He decided to give away 100 apples to neighbors. The rest were stored in crates, with each crate containing 10 apples. How many crates did he use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the farmer harvested a total of 200 apples. He then gave away 100 apples to his neighbors, which left him with 200 - 100 = 100 apples. These remaining apples were stored in crates, each crate holding 10 apples. To find out how many crates were used, we divide the number of apples by the number of apples each crate can hold. This will be 100 apples / 10 apples per crate = 10 crates.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: A pet store received an order of 18 bird cages and 22 fish tanks. If only 30 customers wanted cages or tanks, how many extra did the pet store end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of cages and tanks the pet store received. This is done by adding the bird cages and fish tanks received: 18 bird cages + 22 fish tanks = 40 total cages/tanks. Then, compare this total with the number of customers who wanted cages or tanks, which is 30. The difference between the total cages/tanks and the number of interested customers gives the number of extra cages/tanks: 40 total cages/tanks - 30 customers = 10 extra cages/tanks. Hence, the pet store ended up with 10 extra cages or tanks.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQuestion:  A pet store had 102 puppies.

If there were 50 items in storage and 70 out in the hall, how many trips would she have to make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of items Lucy needs to distribute. This is the sum of items in storage and items out in the hall, which equals 50 + 70 = 120 items. Next, since Lucy can only carry 10 items at a time, divide the total number of items by the amount she can carry per trip. This gives 120 / 10 = 12 trips.

Mark has 2 shelves of t-shirts and each shelf contains 12 shirts, so the total number of t-shirts is 2 shelves multiplied by 12 shirts per shelf. Similarly, he has 3 shelves of dress shirts, with each shelf also containing 12 shirts. Therefore, the total number of dress shirts is 3 shelves multiplied by 12 shirts per shelf.

She made bouquets with 20 roses and used the remainder for decorating a hall. If decorating the hall requires 10 roses per decoration, how many decorations could she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the number of roses used in the bouquets. If each bouquet contains 20 roses and the gardener made bouquets with these, we get: 120 / 20 = 6 bouquets, using up 6 * 20 = 120 roses.

Then, they received an additional delivery of 25 roses. To find the total number of roses after the delivery, we add the initial stock of roses to the roses received in the delivery: 50 roses + 25 roses = 75 roses. Next, we need to determine how many bouquets can be made if each bouquet consists of 5 roses. To do this, we divide the total number of roses by the number of roses per bouquet: 75 roses / 5 roses per bouquet = 15 bouquets. Thus, the florist can make 15 bouquets with the available roses.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: Emily is in the garden planting flowers.

They managed to sell 156 toys during a clearance sale and then stored the leftover toys, placing 8 on each rack. How many racks were occupied?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the warehouse had 200 toys. After selling 156 toys during the clearance sale, the number of toys left = 200 - 156 = 44 toys. These leftover toys were then stored, placing 8 toys on each rack. To find the number of racks occupied, divide the remaining toys by the number of toys per rack: 44 toys / 8 toys per rack = 5.5 racks.

If each folder contains 11 reports, how many reports has Eric filed in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of folders Eric completed. He filed 6 folders one day and 4 the next day, so the total is 6 + 4 = 10 folders. Since each folder contains 11 reports, we multiply the total number of folders by the number of reports per folder: 10 folders * 11 reports/folder = 110 reports. Therefore, Eric has filed 110 reports in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (110)\n\nQ: Tom was clearing out old files in the office, but he could only carry 8 files at a time. If he needed to remove 40 files from one cabinet and 16 files from another, how many trips will he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTom can carry 8 files at once. First, to remove 40 files from one cabinet, he would need to make 40 divided by 8 equals 5 trips. Then, for the 16 files from another cabinet, he would need 16 divided by 8 equals 2 trips. Adding both gives a total of 5 plus 2 equals 7 trips.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQuestion:  Katie had 85 files on her computer. She deleted 40 of them and put the rest into folders with 5 files in each one. How many folders did Katie end up with? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': " Of course, I'd be happy to help you with that! üòä\n\nTo answer the first question, if Victoria received 250 emails and read 50 of them, that means she has 200 unread emails left. If she wants to sort them into 10 folders, she will need to divide the total number of unread emails by the number of folders, which is 200 / 10 = 20 emails per folder.\n\nFor the second question, if Lisa has 42 folders originally and her manager takes 6 of them, she will be left with 36 folders. Since each drawer can hold 4 folders, Lisa will need 36 / 4 = 9 drawers to hold all the folders.\n\nFor the third question, if Eric filed 6 folders on one day and 4 more folders on the next day, he has filed a total of 10 folders. Since each folder contains 11 reports, Eric has filed a total of 10 folders x 11 reports/folder = 110 reports.\n\nFor the fourth question, if Tom can carry 8 files at a time and needs to remove 40 files from one cabinet and 16 files from another, he will make 5 trips for the first cabinet and 2 trips for the second cabinet, for a total of 5 + 2 = 7 trips.\n\nFinally, for the fifth question, if Katie had 85 files on her computer and deleted 40 of them, she will have 45 files left. If she puts the rest into folders with 5 files in each one, she will end up with 45 / 5 = 9 folders.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. üòä", 'true_answer': [9.0]}

If George bought 4 chew toys and 3 balls, how much did he pay in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of toys George bought by adding the chew toys and balls: 4 chew toys + 3 balls = 7 toys. Since each toy costs 7 dollars, the total cost is calculated by multiplying the total number of toys by the cost per toy: 7 toys * 7 dollars/toy = 49 dollars.

How many 10 dollar action figures can he afford with the remainder of his money?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the remaining money Tom has after buying the video game. Tom originally had 120 dollars and spent 50 dollars on a video game, hence the remaining money is 120 - 50 = 70 dollars. Next, we determine how many 10 dollar action figures Tom can afford with his remaining 70 dollars. Since each action figure costs 10 dollars, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of one action figure: 70 / 10 = 7. Therefore, Tom can afford 7 action figures with the remainder of his money.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Tom started off with 15 dollars. He used 7 dollars to buy a toy.
