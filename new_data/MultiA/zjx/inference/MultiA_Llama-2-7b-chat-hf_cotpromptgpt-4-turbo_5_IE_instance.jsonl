This is done by 50 (from store) + 30 (from sale) = 80 supplies in total. Next, we find out the number of usable supplies by subtracting the number of defective supplies from the total supplies. From the information provided, 55 supplies were defective. Therefore, 80 total supplies - 55 defective supplies = 25 usable supplies.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: Emily had 65 algebra equations and 15 geometry problems for homework. If she solved 70 of these problems at school, how many problems did she need to complete later at home?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmily had a total of 65 algebra equations and 15 geometry problems, making it 80 problems altogether. She solved 70 of these problems at school. So, the number of problems left for her to complete at home would be the total problems minus the problems she already solved: 80 - 70 = 10. However, reevaluating the initial problem statement, Emily actually had a total of 80 problems and she solved 70 of them at school, so she would have 80 - 70 = 10 problems to finish at home. But, if we consider that she solved 70 out of these 80, it implies that if there's no indication of any issue or special context (such as problems having to be revised or redone), then it can be deduced that she completed all necessary work within the 70 problems she addressed at school, assuming each problem was solved correctly and to completion.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: Rachel had 50 physics problems and 10 chemistry problems as her schoolwork.

If only 5 customers bought food, how many extra bags did the store end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe pet store initially purchased 30 bags of dog food and 15 bags of cat food, making a total of 45 bags. With only 5 customers purchasing food, the average number of bags per customer would be 45 bags divided by 5 customers, which equals 9 bags per customer. To calculate the extra bags, we need to know how many bags each customer bought, which is not supplied in the problem. It might be assumed that all customers collectively bought all the bags if no extra bags are mentioned explicitly. Therefore, the store may not have ended up with any extra bags.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQuestion:  A pet store had 41 siamese cats and 28 house cats. During a sale they sold 15 cats.

If only 50 toys were sold, how many toys did not find an owner?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe pet store stocked a total of 23 dog toys and 29 cat toys, summing up to 52 toys in total (23 + 29 = 52). During the weekend sale, 50 toys were sold. To find out how many toys did not find an owner, we need to subtract the number of toys sold (50) from the total number of toys available (52).

She received 25 dolls from the estate sale and 15 dolls from the toy store, giving a total of 25 + 15 = 40 dolls. Then, we subtract the number of broken dolls from the total number of dolls to find the number of good condition dolls.

This is done by adding the bird cages and fish tanks received: 18 bird cages + 22 fish tanks = 40 total cages/tanks. Then, compare this total with the number of customers who wanted cages or tanks, which is 30. The difference between the total cages/tanks and the number of interested customers gives the number of extra cages/tanks: 40 total cages/tanks - 30 customers = 10 extra cages/tanks. Hence, the pet store ended up with 10 extra cages or tanks.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: A pet store purchased 30 bags of dog food and 15 bags of cat food for a big sale. If only 5 customers bought food, how many extra bags did the store end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe pet store initially purchased 30 bags of dog food and 15 bags of cat food, making a total of 45 bags. With only 5 customers purchasing food, the average number of bags per customer would be 45 bags divided by 5 customers, which equals 9 bags per customer. To calculate the extra bags, we need to know how many bags each customer bought, which is not supplied in the problem. It might be assumed that all customers collectively bought all the bags if no extra bags are mentioned explicitly. Therefore, the store may not have ended up with any extra bags.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQuestion:  A pet store had 36 siamese cats and 18 house cats. During a sale they sold 26 cats.

If 20 dolls were broken, how many good condition dolls did Jessica end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we find the total number of dolls Jessica received by adding the dolls from the estate sale and from the toy store. She received 25 dolls from the estate sale and 15 dolls from the toy store, giving a total of 25 + 15 = 40 dolls. Then, we subtract the number of broken dolls from the total number of dolls to find the number of good condition dolls.

If 40 of the books were damaged, how many good books did he obtain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of books Sam acquired. He got 35 books from a bookstore and 15 from a flea market, adding them up gives 35 + 15 = 50 books. Next, it's stated that 40 of these books were damaged. To find the number of undamaged or good books, subtract the damaged books from the total books: 50 - 40 = 10. Therefore, Sam obtained 10 good books.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: The library ordered 50 mystery books and 35 science fiction books for a reading event. However, if only 60 attendees wanted books, how many extra books did the library end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of books ordered by the library. The library ordered 50 mystery books and 35 science fiction books, so the total number of books ordered is 50 + 35 = 85 books. Next, consider the number of attendees wanting books, which is 60. The number of extra books is then determined by the difference between the books ordered and the attendees wanting books, which is 85 - 60 = 25 books. Thus, the library ended up with 25 extra books.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: A librarian had 78 books. If she lent out 36 of them and then later received 20 more, how many books would she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the librarian has 78 books. After lending out 36 books, she would have 78 - 36 = 42 books left. If she then receives 20 more books, the total books she would have is 42 + 20 = 62.\nTherefore, the answer is (62)\n\nQ: A library had 120 books on a shelf. If they loaned out 45 books, but then received 10 more books, how many books would be on the shelf?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the library had 120 books. After loaning out 45 books, the number of books left on the shelf becomes 120 - 45 = 75. Then, they received 10 more books, making the total number of books on the shelf 75 + 10 = 85.\nTherefore, the answer is (85)\n\nQ: A library ordered 57 copies of a new book and 45 copies of an old book for a local book club. If only 4 people showed interest, how many extra books did the library end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of books ordered by the library. This is done by adding the number of new books and old books ordered: 57 (new books) + 45 (old books) = 102 books in total. Next, divide this number by the number of people who showed interest to determine how many books each person would need if they were to distribute evenly: 102 books / 4 people = 25.5 books per person. Since it's unlikely the books were cut in half and given out, we assume each person gets 25 books, meaning 4 * 25 = 100 books are distributed. Therefore, the library ends up with 102 total ordered - 100 distributed = 2 extra books.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQuestion:  A book store had 41 books in the bargin bin.

In the afternoon, she attended to another 20 clients. If 12 clients did not get a hair wash, how many clients did get a hair wash?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, determine the total number of clients the hairdresser managed throughout the day by adding the clients from the morning and afternoon. Morning: 10 clients, Afternoon: 20 clients. Total = 10 + 20 = 30 clients. Next, since 12 clients did not get a hair wash, subtract this number from the total number of clients to find how many did get a hair wash.

If they sold 6 bouquets, but then created 13 more, how many bouquets would be in the cooler?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe flower shop started with 9 bouquets. After selling 6 bouquets, they had 9 - 6 = 3 bouquets left. Then, they created 13 more bouquets, which means they added these to the existing 3, resulting in 3 + 13 = 16 bouquets in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (16)\n\nQ: A florist had 87 flowers in a shop. If they sold 40 flowers, but then received 11 new flowers, how many flowers would be in the shop?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the remaining flowers after sales by subtracting the number of flowers sold from the initial amount. Initially, there were 87 flowers and 40 were sold, so 87 - 40 = 47 flowers remained. Then, the florist received 11 new flowers, so add these to the remaining flowers to find the total.

Next, consider that each bouquet purchased represents a combination of roses and tulips. If 125 bouquets were sold and assuming a worst-case scenario each bouquet used at least 1 flower, 125 flowers in total would be used. If each bouquet used at least 3 flowers, 375 flowers would be used, which exceeds the total prepared, leading to zero extra flowers with a practical bouquet composition. It's safe to assume that each bouquet uses at least 2 to 3 flowers and thus all 350 flowers would adequately be accounted for in 125 bouquets.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: A gardening center stocked 48 rose bushes and 36 tulip bulbs for a spring garden sale.

If they sold 40 flowers, but then received 11 new flowers, how many flowers would be in the shop?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the remaining flowers after sales by subtracting the number of flowers sold from the initial amount. Initially, there were 87 flowers and 40 were sold, so 87 - 40 = 47 flowers remained. Then, the florist received 11 new flowers, so add these to the remaining flowers to find the total.

The nursery bought 90 roses and 70 tulips, which sums up to 90 + 70 = 160 flowers. Next, we determine how many flowers were needed for the 140 guests; each guest wanted one flower, so 140 flowers were needed. Lastly, we calculate the difference between the total number of flowers bought and the number needed. This is 160 - 140 = 20.

Next, consider that each bouquet purchased represents a combination of roses and tulips. If 125 bouquets were sold and assuming a worst-case scenario each bouquet used at least 1 flower, 125 flowers in total would be used. If each bouquet used at least 3 flowers, 375 flowers would be used, which exceeds the total prepared, leading to zero extra flowers with a practical bouquet composition. It's safe to assume that each bouquet uses at least 2 to 3 flowers and thus all 350 flowers would adequately be accounted for in 125 bouquets.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: A florist had 72 flowers in a vase.

How many extra flowers did the shop end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, sum the total flowers prepared by the shop: 200 roses + 150 tulips = 350 flowers. Next, consider that each bouquet purchased represents a combination of roses and tulips. If 125 bouquets were sold and assuming a worst-case scenario each bouquet used at least 1 flower, 125 flowers in total would be used. If each bouquet used at least 3 flowers, 375 flowers would be used, which exceeds the total prepared, leading to zero extra flowers with a practical bouquet composition. It's safe to assume that each bouquet uses at least 2 to 3 flowers and thus all 350 flowers would adequately be accounted for in 125 bouquets.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: A nursery purchased 90 roses and 70 tulips for a special event.

Each cage holds 4 lions and 3 tigers, so adding them together gives 4 + 3 = 7 animals per cage. Since there are 5 cages, the total number of animals across all cages would be 7 animals per cage multiplied by 5 cages, which is 7 * 5 = 35. Therefore, the zookeeper has a total of 35 animals.\nTherefore, the answer is (35)\n\nQ: A pet store purchased 30 bags of dog food and 15 bags of cat food for a big sale. If only 5 customers bought food, how many extra bags did the store end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe pet store initially purchased 30 bags of dog food and 15 bags of cat food, making a total of 45 bags. With only 5 customers purchasing food, the average number of bags per customer would be 45 bags divided by 5 customers, which equals 9 bags per customer. To calculate the extra bags, we need to know how many bags each customer bought, which is not supplied in the problem. It might be assumed that all customers collectively bought all the bags if no extra bags are mentioned explicitly. Therefore, the store may not have ended up with any extra bags.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: A farm has 4 hen houses. If each house has 6 chickens and 5 ducks, how many birds are there in total on the farm?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of chickens in all hen houses. Since each house has 6 chickens and there are 4 houses, there are 6 chickens per house multiplied by 4 houses, which gives 6 * 4 = 24 chickens. Similarly, calculate the total number of ducks. Each house has 5 ducks, and there are 4 houses, so there are 5 ducks per house multiplied by 4 houses, which results in 5 * 4 = 20 ducks. To find the total number of birds, sum the total number of chickens and ducks together, which is 24 chickens + 20 ducks = 44 birds.\nTherefore, the answer is (44)\n\nQ: A pet store received an order of 18 bird cages and 22 fish tanks. If only 30 customers wanted cages or tanks, how many extra did the pet store end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of cages and tanks the pet store received. This is done by adding the bird cages and fish tanks received: 18 bird cages + 22 fish tanks = 40 total cages/tanks. Then, compare this total with the number of customers who wanted cages or tanks, which is 30. The difference between the total cages/tanks and the number of interested customers gives the number of extra cages/tanks: 40 total cages/tanks - 30 customers = 10 extra cages/tanks. Hence, the pet store ended up with 10 extra cages or tanks.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQuestion:  A pet store has 9 bird cages.

Henry worked 5 hours and his hourly wage is 20 dollars. So, his earning for Friday = 5 hours * 20 dollars/hour = 100 dollars.\nStep 2: Calculate earnings for Saturday. Henry worked 6 hours, so his earning for Saturday = 6 hours * 20 dollars/hour = 120 dollars.\nStep 3: Sum the earnings of Friday and Saturday to find the total. Total earnings = Earnings on Friday + Earnings on Saturday = 100 dollars + 120 dollars = 220 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (220)\n\nQ: Paul was a waiter at a restaurant earning 10 dollars an hour.

How many animals total did the zookeeper have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out the total number of animals, first, consider the number of animals in a single cage. Each cage holds 4 lions and 3 tigers, so adding them together gives 4 + 3 = 7 animals per cage. Since there are 5 cages, the total number of animals across all cages would be 7 animals per cage multiplied by 5 cages, which is 7 * 5 = 35. Therefore, the zookeeper has a total of 35 animals.\nTherefore, the answer is (35)\n\nQ: A farm has 4 hen houses. If each house has 6 chickens and 5 ducks, how many birds are there in total on the farm?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of chickens in all hen houses.

Each house has 5 ducks, and there are 4 houses, so there are 5 ducks per house multiplied by 4 houses, which results in 5 * 4 = 20 ducks. To find the total number of birds, sum the total number of chickens and ducks together, which is 24 chickens + 20 ducks = 44 birds.\nTherefore, the answer is (44)\n\nQ: A pet store received an order of 18 bird cages and 22 fish tanks.

This is done by adding the bird cages and fish tanks received: 18 bird cages + 22 fish tanks = 40 total cages/tanks. Then, compare this total with the number of customers who wanted cages or tanks, which is 30. The difference between the total cages/tanks and the number of interested customers gives the number of extra cages/tanks: 40 total cages/tanks - 30 customers = 10 extra cages/tanks. Hence, the pet store ended up with 10 extra cages or tanks.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQuestion:  A pet store has 8 bird cages.

', 'idx': 274, 'prompt': "Q: A pet shop had 25 hamsters in a cage. If they sold 18 of the old ones and brought in 8 new ones, how many hamsters would be in the cage?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 25 hamsters. After selling 18 of them, there are 25 - 18 = 7 hamsters left. The pet shop then added 8 new hamsters, making the total 7 + 8 = 15 hamsters.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: A zookeeper had 5 cages with different animals, holding 4 lions and 3 tigers in each cage. How many animals total did the zookeeper have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out the total number of animals, first, consider the number of animals in a single cage. Each cage holds 4 lions and 3 tigers, so adding them together gives 4 + 3 = 7 animals per cage. Since there are 5 cages, the total number of animals across all cages would be 7 animals per cage multiplied by 5 cages, which is 7 * 5 = 35. Therefore, the zookeeper has a total of 35 animals.\nTherefore, the answer is (35)\n\nQ: A farm has 6 chicken coops. If each coop houses 5 chickens and 3 roosters, how many poultry birds are there on the farm in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of chickens and roosters in one coop: 5 chickens + 3 roosters = 8 birds per coop. Since there are 6 coops, calculate the total number of birds on the farm by multiplying the number of birds per coop by the number of coops: 8 birds/coop * 6 coops = 48 birds. Therefore, there are 48 poultry birds on the farm in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (48)\n\nQ: A farm has 4 hen houses. If each house has 6 chickens and 5 ducks, how many birds are there in total on the farm?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of chickens in all hen houses.

Each house has 5 ducks, and there are 4 houses, so there are 5 ducks per house multiplied by 4 houses, which results in 5 * 4 = 20 ducks. To find the total number of birds, sum the total number of chickens and ducks together, which is 24 chickens + 20 ducks = 44 birds.\nTherefore, the answer is (44)\n\nQ: A pet store received an order of 18 bird cages and 22 fish tanks.

This is done by adding the bird cages and fish tanks received: 18 bird cages + 22 fish tanks = 40 total cages/tanks. Then, compare this total with the number of customers who wanted cages or tanks, which is 30. The difference between the total cages/tanks and the number of interested customers gives the number of extra cages/tanks: 40 total cages/tanks - 30 customers = 10 extra cages/tanks. Hence, the pet store ended up with 10 extra cages or tanks.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQuestion:  A pet store has 4 bird cages.

', 'idx': 331, 'prompt': "Q: During a charity fun run event, there were 36 boys and 48 girls participating. If groups of 12 are required, how many groups can be made?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, add the number of boys and girls to get the total number of participants: 36 boys + 48 girls = 84 participants. Next, since groups must consist of 12 participants, divide the total number of participants by 12 to see how many full groups of 12 can be formed: 84 participants √∑ 12 = 7 groups. Therefore, 7 full groups of 12 can be made from the 84 participants.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: At the regional debate, 15 girls and 25 boys, totaling 40 students, competed.

Next, identify the number of students chosen to progress which is 30. To find out how many students were not selected, subtract the number of students chosen from the total number of students. Therefore, 40 (total students) - 30 (students chosen) = 10 (students not selected).\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: During a science fair, there were 18 projects, each with 3 participants, and 6 projects with 2 participants. If they were organized into groups of 10, how many groups could be made?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of participants in the projects. For 18 projects with each having 3 participants, there are 18 * 3 = 54 participants. For 6 projects with each having 2 participants, there are 6 * 2 = 12 participants. So, the total number of participants is 54 + 12 = 66. Then, divide the total number of participants by the number of participants per group to find the number of groups. 66 participants divided into groups of 10 gives 66 / 10 = 6.6. Since a group cannot have a fraction of a person, and you typically can't have a group with fewer than the set number per group in this context, only 6 full groups of 10 can be formed. The remaining 6 participants are not enough to form an additional group of 10.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: In the school play audition, there were 5 girls and 6 boys participating. If only 4 of them were selected for roles, how many did not get a part?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, to determine how many did not get a part in the school play, we need to find the total number of students who auditioned. Since there were 5 girls and 6 boys participating, this adds up to 5 + 6 = 11 students. Next, since 4 students were selected for roles, we subtract this from the total number of participants to find the number of students who did not get a part. Thus, 11 - 4 = 7 students did not get a part.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: There were 30 children, with 14 girls and 16 boys, who tried out for the school's play.

There were 30 children who tried out, and 8 children got a role. By subtracting the number of children who got a role from the total number that tried out, we get the number of children who did not make it into the play. So, the calculation is 30 (total children) - 8 (children who got a role) = 22.\nTherefore, the answer is (22)\n\nQuestion:  The schools debate team had 28 boys and 4 girls on it.

", 'idx': 371, 'prompt': "Q: A youth club is going on an excursion. If each minivan can transport 7 attendees and there are 21 members and 2 coordinators in the group, how many minivans will they have to use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, determine the total number of people going on the excursion, which includes both members and coordinators. There are 21 members and 2 coordinators, making a total of 21 + 2 = 23 people. Each minivan can transport 7 attendees. To find out how many minivans are needed, divide the total number of people by the capacity of one minivan. 23 divided by 7 is approximately 3.29, which means they would need at least 4 minivans to transport everyone because a minivan cannot transport a fraction of a person.\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQ: Ben was helping at the community center set up for an event, but he could only carry 8 chairs at a time.

If there were 21 books in the fiction section and 29 books in the non-fiction section, how many trips must he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many trips John has to make to gather all the books from both the fiction and non-fiction sections, we need to calculate the number of trips required for each section separately, and then sum those totals. First, for the fiction section with 21 books, since John can carry 7 books at a time: 21 books divided by 7 books per trip equals 3 trips. Next, for the non-fiction section with 29 books, dividing this by 7 gives about 4.14, which means he actually needs to make 5 trips (because he can't make a fraction of a trip and he needs an additional trip for the remaining books). Therefore, total trips = trips for fiction + trips for non-fiction = 3 + 5 = 8.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: Each book in a pile costs $5.

If 150 meals have already been prepared, how much longer will it take to prepare the remaining meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe chef needs to prepare 200 meals and each meal takes 0.5 hours to prepare. Out of these, 150 meals have already been prepared. To find out the time required to prepare the remaining meals, first find the number of meals left by subtracting the number of meals already made from the total meals needed. The calculation is 200 - 150 = 50 meals left to prepare. Since each meal takes 0.5 hours, the total time needed for 50 meals is 50 meals * 0.5 hours/meal = 25 hours.

If a group of 10 people visited and 7 were children, how much would it cost for the group to have their drinks?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, evaluate the number of adults in the group, which is 10 total people minus 7 children, giving 3 adults. Each adult coffee is $5. So, the total cost for the adult coffees is 3 adults times $5 each, which equals $15. Since children's hot chocolate is free, there is no additional cost for the 7 children's drinks. Adding the costs together, the total cost for the group‚Äôs drinks is just for the adult coffees which is $15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: In a cafeteria, each adult plate costs $6 and salad is free for kids. If a group of 20 people came in and 12 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, determine the number of adults and children in the group from the total of 20 people, with 12 being kids, it follows that there are 8 adults. Each adult plate costs $6, hence, the total cost for all adult plates is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per plate, which is 8 * $6 = $48. Since salads are free for kids, there is no additional cost for the 12 kids. Thus, the total cost for the group to eat is simply the cost of the adult plates.\nTherefore, the answer is (48)\n\nQ: At a buffet, each adult entry fee is $10 and kids under 5 eat free. If a group of 13 people visited and 7 were under the age of 5, what would be the total cost for the group?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are 13 people in total in the group, out of which 7 are under the age of 5 and hence they eat for free. This means there are 13 - 7 = 6 people who are paying the adult entry fee of $10 each. Thus, the total cost for the group would be 6 adults * $10/adult = $60.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQ: At a diner each adult burger costs $8 while a kid's meal is free. If a party of 15 comes in and 10 are kids, what would be the total cost for the party to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total cost of the meals for the party, we need to determine the number of adults and children. The problem states that there are 15 people in total and 10 of them are kids. The number of adults is 15 - 10 = 5. Each adult burger costs $8, so the cost for the adult burgers is 5 adults x $8/adult = $40. Since kid's meals are free, there is no cost associated with the 10 kids' meals. Adding the costs gives us a total cost of $40 for the adults' meals only, as the kids' meals are free.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: In a fast food joint, each burger costs $4 and fries come free. If a party of 15 people entered and 9 were kids who ate fries, how much would it cost for the party?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, identify the number of people who consumed burgers. Since 9 kids ate only fries and there were 15 people in total, the number of people who ate burgers is 15 - 9 = 6. Each burger costs $4, therefore the total cost for burgers is 6 * $4 = $24. Since fries are free, there are no additional costs for the fries. Hence, the total cost for the party is solely from the burgers which is $24.\nTherefore, the answer is (24)\n\nQuestion:  At a restaurant each adult meal costs $5 and kids eat free.

If she had only baked 15 of them as guests arrived, how many did she not bake?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLaura needed to bake a total of 40 cupcakes and 20 cookies which adds up to 60 treats. If she only managed to bake 15 items as guests arrived, the number of items she did not bake would be the total initial amount minus what she baked by the time the guests arrived.

If a group of 10 people visited and 7 were children, how much would it cost for the group to have their drinks?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, evaluate the number of adults in the group, which is 10 total people minus 7 children, giving 3 adults. Each adult coffee is $5. So, the total cost for the adult coffees is 3 adults times $5 each, which equals $15. Since children's hot chocolate is free, there is no additional cost for the 7 children's drinks. Adding the costs together, the total cost for the group‚Äôs drinks is just for the adult coffees which is $15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: At a diner each adult burger costs $8 while a kid's meal is free. If a party of 15 comes in and 10 are kids, what would be the total cost for the party to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total cost of the meals for the party, we need to determine the number of adults and children. The problem states that there are 15 people in total and 10 of them are kids. The number of adults is 15 - 10 = 5. Each adult burger costs $8, so the cost for the adult burgers is 5 adults x $8/adult = $40. Since kid's meals are free, there is no cost associated with the 10 kids' meals. Adding the costs gives us a total cost of $40 for the adults' meals only, as the kids' meals are free.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: At a buffet, each adult entry fee is $10 and kids under 5 eat free. If a group of 13 people visited and 7 were under the age of 5, what would be the total cost for the group?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are 13 people in total in the group, out of which 7 are under the age of 5 and hence they eat for free. This means there are 13 - 7 = 6 people who are paying the adult entry fee of $10 each. Thus, the total cost for the group would be 6 adults * $10/adult = $60.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQ: In a cafeteria, each adult plate costs $6 and salad is free for kids.

Each adult plate costs $6, hence, the total cost for all adult plates is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per plate, which is 8 * $6 = $48. Since salads are free for kids, there is no additional cost for the 12 kids. Thus, the total cost for the group to eat is simply the cost of the adult plates.\nTherefore, the answer is (48)\n\nQ: In a fast food joint, each burger costs $4 and fries come free.

', 'idx': 483, 'prompt': "Q: In a cafeteria, each adult plate costs $6 and salad is free for kids. If a group of 20 people came in and 12 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, determine the number of adults and children in the group from the total of 20 people, with 12 being kids, it follows that there are 8 adults. Each adult plate costs $6, hence, the total cost for all adult plates is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per plate, which is 8 * $6 = $48. Since salads are free for kids, there is no additional cost for the 12 kids. Thus, the total cost for the group to eat is simply the cost of the adult plates.\nTherefore, the answer is (48)\n\nQ: At a cafe, each adult coffee costs $3 and children's hot chocolate is free. If a group of 12 people visited and 7 of them were children, how much would it cost for the group to drink?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much it would cost for the group to drink, we need to calculate the total cost of drinks for the adults only, since children's hot chocolate is free. Given that each adult coffee costs $3, we first determine how many adults are in the group. From a total of 12 people, 7 of them are children, so there are 12 - 7 = 5 adults. The total cost for the adults' coffee is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per coffee: 5 adults * $3 per coffee = $15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: At a diner each adult burger costs $8 while a kid's meal is free. If a party of 15 comes in and 10 are kids, what would be the total cost for the party to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total cost of the meals for the party, we need to determine the number of adults and children. The problem states that there are 15 people in total and 10 of them are kids. The number of adults is 15 - 10 = 5. Each adult burger costs $8, so the cost for the adult burgers is 5 adults x $8/adult = $40. Since kid's meals are free, there is no cost associated with the 10 kids' meals. Adding the costs gives us a total cost of $40 for the adults' meals only, as the kids' meals are free.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: In a fast food joint, each burger costs $4 and fries come free. If a party of 15 people entered and 9 were kids who ate fries, how much would it cost for the party?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, identify the number of people who consumed burgers. Since 9 kids ate only fries and there were 15 people in total, the number of people who ate burgers is 15 - 9 = 6. Each burger costs $4, therefore the total cost for burgers is 6 * $4 = $24. Since fries are free, there are no additional costs for the fries. Hence, the total cost for the party is solely from the burgers which is $24.\nTherefore, the answer is (24)\n\nQ: In a cafe each adult coffee costs $5 and children's hot chocolate is free. If a group of 10 people visited and 7 were children, how much would it cost for the group to have their drinks?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, evaluate the number of adults in the group, which is 10 total people minus 7 children, giving 3 adults. Each adult coffee is $5. So, the total cost for the adult coffees is 3 adults times $5 each, which equals $15. Since children's hot chocolate is free, there is no additional cost for the 7 children's drinks. Adding the costs together, the total cost for the group‚Äôs drinks is just for the adult coffees which is $15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQuestion:  At a restaurant each adult meal costs $8 and kids eat free.

If a party of 15 people entered and 9 were kids who ate fries, how much would it cost for the party?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, identify the number of people who consumed burgers. Since 9 kids ate only fries and there were 15 people in total, the number of people who ate burgers is 15 - 9 = 6. Each burger costs $4, therefore the total cost for burgers is 6 * $4 = $24. Since fries are free, there are no additional costs for the fries.

If a group of 12 people visited and 7 of them were children, how much would it cost for the group to drink?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much it would cost for the group to drink, we need to calculate the total cost of drinks for the adults only, since children's hot chocolate is free. Given that each adult coffee costs $3, we first determine how many adults are in the group. From a total of 12 people, 7 of them are children, so there are 12 - 7 = 5 adults. The total cost for the adults' coffee is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per coffee: 5 adults * $3 per coffee = $15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: At a buffet, each adult entry fee is $10 and kids under 5 eat free.

This means there are 13 - 7 = 6 people who are paying the adult entry fee of $10 each. Thus, the total cost for the group would be 6 adults * $10/adult = $60.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQ: In a cafeteria, each adult plate costs $6 and salad is free for kids.

Each adult plate costs $6, hence, the total cost for all adult plates is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per plate, which is 8 * $6 = $48. Since salads are free for kids, there is no additional cost for the 12 kids. Thus, the total cost for the group to eat is simply the cost of the adult plates.\nTherefore, the answer is (48)\n\nQ: In a cafe each adult coffee costs $5 and children's hot chocolate is free. If a group of 10 people visited and 7 were children, how much would it cost for the group to have their drinks?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, evaluate the number of adults in the group, which is 10 total people minus 7 children, giving 3 adults. Each adult coffee is $5. So, the total cost for the adult coffees is 3 adults times $5 each, which equals $15.

She arranges them into 12 different baskets, with each basket having the same number of treats. How many treats were in each basket?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLaura has a total of 24 muffins and 36 cookies. Adding the muffins and cookies together gives us 24 + 36 = 60 treats in total. These treats are to be evenly distributed into 12 baskets. To find out how many treats each basket will have, divide the total number of treats by the number of baskets. This calculation is 60 treats / 12 baskets = 5 treats per basket.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Laura needed to bake 40 cupcakes and 20 cookies for a party. If she had only baked 15 of them as guests arrived, how many did she not bake?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLaura needed to bake a total of 40 cupcakes and 20 cookies which adds up to 60 treats. If she only managed to bake 15 items as guests arrived, the number of items she did not bake would be the total initial amount minus what she baked by the time the guests arrived. So, 60 (total to bake) - 15 (baked by arrival) = 45.\nTherefore, the answer is (45)\n\nQ: Rachel was baking cookies for a party. On the first day, she baked 6 batches of cookies and on the second day, she baked 4 more batches. If each batch included 9 cookies, how many cookies did she bake in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of batches Rachel baked by adding the batches from both days. On the first day, she baked 6 batches, and on the second day, she baked 4 batches. Thus, total batches = 6 + 4 = 10 batches. Next, we find out the total number of cookies by multiplying the number of batches by the number of cookies in each batch. Since each batch contained 9 cookies, the total cookies = 10 batches * 9 cookies/batch = 90 cookies. Therefore, Rachel baked 90 cookies in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (90)\n\nQuestion:  Chloe baked 7 brownies, but needed 16 total for her party.

Thus, Mark will need 9 boxes to package all the cookies.\nTherefore, the answer is (9)\n\nQ: Mark was sorting his comic books into boxes with 5 comics in each box. If he had 8 new comics and 12 old comics to store, how many boxes would he use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of comics Mark has by adding the number of new comics and old comics. He has 8 new comics and 12 old comics, so the total number of comics is 8 + 12 = 20. Next, since each box holds 5 comics, we divide the total number of comics by 5 to find out how many boxes he would need. Therefore, the calculation is 20 / 5 = 4 boxes. Hence, Mark would use 4 boxes to store all his comics.\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQ: Alex was setting up his video game collection with exactly 7 games per shelf. If he had 8 shelves of adventure games and 2 shelves of puzzle games, how many games did he have altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of games on the shelves dedicated to adventure games. With 7 games per shelf and 8 shelves, the calculation is 7 games x 8 shelves = 56 games for adventure. Next, compute the total number of games on the shelves dedicated to puzzle games. Again, with 7 games per shelf and 2 shelves, the calculation comes to 7 games x 2 shelves = 14 games for puzzle. Finally, add the total games of adventure and puzzle together to get the total number of games. So, add 56 games + 14 games = 70 games.\nTherefore, the answer is (70)\n\nQ: Kevin was going through his old gaming collection. He identified 3 boxes of video games and in each box, there were 4 game discs and 2 controllers. How many gaming items did Kevin have total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine what constitutes a 'gaming item' in Kevin's collection, which includes both game discs and controllers. From the problem statement, each of the 3 boxes contains 4 game discs and 2 controllers. To find the total number of game discs, multiply the number of boxes (3) by the number of game discs per box (4): 3 boxes * 4 game discs/box = 12 game discs. Similarly, for the controllers, multiply the number of boxes (3) by the number of controllers per box (2): 3 boxes * 2 controllers/box = 6 controllers. Finally, add the total game discs and controllers together to find the total number of gaming items: 12 game discs + 6 controllers = 18 gaming items.\nTherefore, the answer is (18)\n\nQuestion:  Edward was selling his old games.

After selling 180 cans, the remaining cans would be 300 - 180 = 120 cans. To determine the number of crates required to store these cans, we divide the remaining number of cans by the capacity of each crate, which is 10 cans per crate. Therefore, the number of crates required is 120 / 10 = 12 crates.\nTherefore, the answer is (12)\n\nQ: A pet store received an order of 18 bird cages and 22 fish tanks.

Since Chris can handle a maximum of 7 boxes at a time, we need to determine how many trips it will take for him to carry all 49 boxes. By dividing the total number of boxes by the number of boxes Chris can carry per trip, we get 49 / 7 = 7 trips. Therefore, Chris will need to make 7 trips to organize all the boxes.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Kevin was going through his old gaming collection.

The total points scored by the team were 66. So, the points scored by others were 66 - 42 = 24 points. Assuming everyone else scored 3 points each, we divide the remaining points by 3 to find the number of other players. That is 24 / 3 = 8 players. Including Luke, the total number of players on the team is 8 + 1 = 9.\nTherefore, the answer is (9)\n\nQuestion:  Bianca's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total.

To find out how many she did not prepare, subtract the number of items she prepared from the total she had to prepare: 35 items - 28 prepared = 7 not prepared.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Laura needed to bake 40 cupcakes and 20 cookies for a party. If she had only baked 15 of them as guests arrived, how many did she not bake?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLaura needed to bake a total of 40 cupcakes and 20 cookies which adds up to 60 treats. If she only managed to bake 15 items as guests arrived, the number of items she did not bake would be the total initial amount minus what she baked by the time the guests arrived. So, 60 (total to bake) - 15 (baked by arrival) = 45.\nTherefore, the answer is (45)\n\nQ: Jenna baked 24 cookies and 36 cupcakes for a bake sale. If she arranged the baked goods into 12 different boxes with the same number of treats in each box, how many treats were in each of the boxes?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of treats Jenna baked, which includes both cookies and cupcakes. She made 24 cookies and 36 cupcakes, so the total number of treats is 24 + 36 = 60. Jenna then arranged these 60 treats into 12 different boxes with the same number of treats in each box. To find out how many treats were in each box, we divide the total number of treats by the number of boxes: 60 treats / 12 boxes = 5 treats per box.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Sarah prepared 102 cupcakes for a bake sale. She needed to place them in trays of 6 each. After accidentally dropping some, she had 90 cupcakes left. How many full trays can she still line up?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst we'll calculate how many cupcakes Sarah had left after dropping some. She originally had 102 cupcakes and dropped some leaving her with 90 cupcakes. Next, we need to figure out how many full trays of 6 cupcakes each she can still line up with the 90 cupcakes left. To do this, divide the number of cupcakes she has left by the number of cupcakes that can fit in a tray. So, 90 cupcakes divided by 6 cupcakes per tray equals 15 trays. Thus, she can line up 15 full trays with the cupcakes remaining.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQuestion:  Sarah baked 38 cupcakes for her school's bake sale.

{'question': ' Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook. She put 37 pics into one album and put the rest into 2 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? ', 'idx': 599, 'prompt': "Q: Tom shot 130 photos with his DSLR and 70 with his smartphone during his trip. If he created 20 different photo albums with the same number of photos in each album, how many photos were in each album?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we find the total number of photos Tom shot: 130 photos with his DSLR plus 70 photos with his smartphone, which sum up to 200 photos in total. Then, since he created 20 different photo albums and each album has the same number of photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of albums. Therefore, 200 total photos divided by 20 albums equals 10 photos per album.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Alice needed to sort 100 old photos and label 50 new ones before her exhibition. If she managed only 70 of them by the opening day, how many did she not handle?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nAlice had a total task of handling 150 photos (100 old ones and 50 new ones). By opening day, she completed 70 photos. To find the number of photos she did not handle, subtract the ones she handled from the total: 150 total - 70 handled = 80 not handled.\nTherefore, the answer is (80)\n\nQ: Jennifer is sorting her photographs into an album with 8 photos per page. If she wants to archive 3 new photos and 17 old photos, how many pages will she use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, let's calculate the total number of photos Jennifer wants to archive. She has 3 new photos and 17 old photos, which gives a total of 3 + 17 = 20 photos. Each page of her album holds 8 photos. To find out the total number of pages she will use, divide the total number of photos by the number of photos per page: 20 photos / 8 photos per page = 2.5 pages. Since she can't use half a page, she will need 3 full pages to accommodate all her photos.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: Anna was sorting her photographs into albums. She had 3 albums for vacation photos and 2 albums for family events. If each album could contain 20 photographs, how many photographs did Anna organize?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of albums Anna has for vacation photos and family events. She has 3 albums for vacation photos and 2 albums for family events, which adds up to 3 + 2 = 5 albums. Each album can contain 20 photographs. Therefore, to find the total number of photographs Anna organized, multiply the total number of albums by the number of photographs each album can contain: 5 albums * 20 photographs/album = 100 photographs.\nTherefore, the answer is (100)\n\nQ: Sarah was placing her photographs in an album with 6 photos on each page. After taking 5 new photos and having 53 old photos, how many album pages did she use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of photos Sarah has by adding her old photos and new photos. She has 53 old photos and she took 5 new ones, so 53 + 5 = 58 photos in total. Each album page can hold 6 photos, so to find the number of pages she used, divide the total number of photos by the number of photos each page can hold. Calculate 58 / 6 = 9.67. Since she can't use a fraction of a page, round up to the next whole number, which is 10. Therefore, Sarah used 10 full pages to hold all her photos.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQuestion:  Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook.
