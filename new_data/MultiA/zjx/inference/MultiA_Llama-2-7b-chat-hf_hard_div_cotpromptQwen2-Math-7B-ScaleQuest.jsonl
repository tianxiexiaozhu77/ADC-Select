To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  The school cafeteria ordered 43 red apples and 32 green apples for students lunches.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  Haley and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Haley picked 39 and her mother picked 38. If only 64 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': " Great, let's solve this problem together!\n\nSo, Haley picked 39 carrots and her mother picked 38 carrots. If only 64 of the carrots were good, that means the total number of carrots they picked is:\n\n39 + 38 = 77\n\nNow, we need to find out how many of these carrots are good. Since only 64 of the carrots are good, the number of bad carrots is:\n\n77 - 64 = 13\n\nSo, Haley and her mother have 13 bad carrots.\n\nGreat job!

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  Maria picked 48 carrots from her garden.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.

They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  A store had 40 oranges in a bin.

They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  A pet store has 8 bird cages.

If each cage has 2 parrots and 7 parakeets in it, how many birds does the pet store have total?\nA: Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Calculate the number of parrots in the pet store:\n   Each cage has 2 parrots, and there are 8 cages, so the total number of parrots is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 8 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, there are 16 parrots in the pet store.\n\n2. Calculate the number of parakeets in the pet store:\n   Each cage has 7 parakeets, and there are 8 cages, so the total number of parakeets is:\n   \\[\n   7 \\times 8 = 56\n   \\]\n   So, there are 56 parakeets in the pet store.\n\n3. Add the number of parrots and parakeets to find the total number of birds in the pet store:\n   The total number of birds in the pet store is:\n   \\[\n   16 + 56 = 72\n   \\]\n   So, the pet store has 72 birds in total.\n\nTherefore, the number of birds the pet store has is \\(\\boxed{72}\\).", 'true_answer': [72.0]}

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  A new building needed 10 windows. The builder had already installed 6 of them. If it takes 5 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': " Great, let's help Oliver, Haley, and the builder with their tasks! 😊\n\nFor Oliver, he needs to put away 36 books on 9 shelves. Since he can fit 4 books on each shelf, it will take him 9 shelves to put away all the books. Therefore, it will take him 9 hours to put away all the books (since there are 9 shelves and each shelf takes 4 hours to fill).\n\nFor Haley, she spent $32 on tickets.\n\nFor the builder, it will take him 5 hours to install each window. Since he has already installed 6 windows, it will take him 5 hours to install the remaining 4 windows (since 4 windows x 5 hours = 20 hours).\n\nI hope this helps you with your questions!

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  A new building needed 14 windows. The builder had already installed 8 of them. If it takes 8 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': " Great, let's help Oliver, Haley, and the builder with their tasks! 😊\n\nFor Oliver, he needs to put away 36 books on 9 shelves. So, he will need to fit 4 books on each shelf. To find out how long it will take him to put away all the books, we can divide the total number of books by the number of books he can fit on each shelf:\n\n\\[ \\frac{36}{4} = 9 \\text{ shelves} \\]\n\nSince 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books. It will take him 9 times as long to put away all the books, so it will take him:\n\n\\[ 9 \\times 4 = 36 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nFor Haley, she spent $\\boxed{32}$ dollars on tickets. If each ticket costs $4 dollars, then she spent a total of:\n\n\\[ 32 \\times 4 = 128 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nFor the builder, it will take him $\\boxed{8}$ hours to install each window. Since he needs to install 14 windows in total, it will take him:\n\n\\[ 14 \\times 8 = 112 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nI hope this helps you with your questions! Let me know if you have any more. 😊", 'true_answer': [48.0]}

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.

They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.
