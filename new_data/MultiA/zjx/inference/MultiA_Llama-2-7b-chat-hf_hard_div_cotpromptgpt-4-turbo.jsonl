A librarian takes 10 books, leaving Oliver with 36 books to shelve. The capacity of each shelf is 4 books. To find out how many shelves Oliver needs, divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold: 36 books / 4 books per shelf = 9 shelves.

How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe store initially had 40 coloring books. After putting 20 of them on sale, they were left with 40 - 20 = 20 coloring books. These remaining 20 books were then organized onto shelves with 4 books each. To find out how many shelves were used, we divide the total number of remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 20 / 4 = 5. Therefore, 5 shelves were used to store the remaining books.\nTherefore, the answer is (5).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nEdward initially had 35 games and sold 19 of them. To find out how many games are left, we subtract the number of games sold from the total number of games he originally had, which is 35 - 19 = 16 games. Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack these remaining games, with each box holding 8 games. To find this, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold, which is 16 / 8 = 2. Therefore, Edward needs to use 2 boxes to pack the remaining games.\nTherefore, the answer is (2).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

Next, determine the total cost by multiplying the number of tickets (8) by the cost per ticket (4 dollars), which results in 8 * 4 = 32 dollars. Therefore, Haley spent a total of 32 dollars on tickets.\nTherefore, the answer is (32).\n\nQuestion:  Amy had 26 music files and 36 video files on her flash drive.

If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there are 46 books to be shelved. A librarian takes 10 books, leaving Oliver with 36 books to shelve. The capacity of each shelf is 4 books. To find out how many shelves Oliver needs, divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold: 36 books / 4 books per shelf = 9 shelves.

If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there are 46 books to be shelved. A librarian takes 10 books, leaving Oliver with 36 books to shelve. The capacity of each shelf is 4 books. To find out how many shelves Oliver needs, divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold: 36 books / 4 books per shelf = 9 shelves. Therefore, Oliver will need 9 shelves to fit all the books.\nTherefore, the answer is (9).\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe store initially had 40 coloring books. After putting 20 of them on sale, they were left with 40 - 20 = 20 coloring books. These remaining 20 books were then organized onto shelves with 4 books each. To find out how many shelves were used, we divide the total number of remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 20 / 4 = 5.

He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nEdward initially had 35 games and sold 19 of them. To find out how many games are left, we subtract the number of games sold from the total number of games he originally had, which is 35 - 19 = 16 games. Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack these remaining games, with each box holding 8 games. To find this, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold, which is 16 / 8 = 2. Therefore, Edward needs to use 2 boxes to pack the remaining games.\nTherefore, the answer is (2).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

A librarian takes 10 books, leaving Oliver with 36 books to shelve. The capacity of each shelf is 4 books. To find out how many shelves Oliver needs, divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold: 36 books / 4 books per shelf = 9 shelves. Therefore, Oliver will need 9 shelves to fit all the books.\nTherefore, the answer is (9).\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe store initially had 40 coloring books. After putting 20 of them on sale, they were left with 40 - 20 = 20 coloring books. These remaining 20 books were then organized onto shelves with 4 books each. To find out how many shelves were used, we divide the total number of remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 20 / 4 = 5. Therefore, 5 shelves were used to store the remaining books.\nTherefore, the answer is (5).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nEdward initially had 35 games and sold 19 of them. To find out how many games are left, we subtract the number of games sold from the total number of games he originally had, which is 35 - 19 = 16 games. Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack these remaining games, with each box holding 8 games. To find this, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold, which is 16 / 8 = 2. Therefore, Edward needs to use 2 boxes to pack the remaining games.\nTherefore, the answer is (2).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

Next, determine the total cost by multiplying the number of tickets (8) by the cost per ticket (4 dollars), which results in 8 * 4 = 32 dollars. Therefore, Haley spent a total of 32 dollars on tickets.\nTherefore, the answer is (32).\n\nQuestion:  Roger was putting his spare change into piles. He had 3 piles of quarters and 3 piles of dimes.

To find out how many shelves Oliver needs, divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold: 36 books / 4 books per shelf = 9 shelves. Therefore, Oliver will need 9 shelves to fit all the books.\nTherefore, the answer is (9).\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe store initially had 40 coloring books. After putting 20 of them on sale, they were left with 40 - 20 = 20 coloring books. These remaining 20 books were then organized onto shelves with 4 books each. To find out how many shelves were used, we divide the total number of remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 20 / 4 = 5. Therefore, 5 shelves were used to store the remaining books.\nTherefore, the answer is (5).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nEdward initially had 35 games and sold 19 of them. To find out how many games are left, we subtract the number of games sold from the total number of games he originally had, which is 35 - 19 = 16 games. Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack these remaining games, with each box holding 8 games. To find this, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold, which is 16 / 8 = 2. Therefore, Edward needs to use 2 boxes to pack the remaining games.\nTherefore, the answer is (2).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

Next, determine the total cost by multiplying the number of tickets (8) by the cost per ticket (4 dollars), which results in 8 * 4 = 32 dollars.

How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe store initially had 40 coloring books. After putting 20 of them on sale, they were left with 40 - 20 = 20 coloring books. These remaining 20 books were then organized onto shelves with 4 books each. To find out how many shelves were used, we divide the total number of remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 20 / 4 = 5. Therefore, 5 shelves were used to store the remaining books.\nTherefore, the answer is (5).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nEdward initially had 35 games and sold 19 of them. To find out how many games are left, we subtract the number of games sold from the total number of games he originally had, which is 35 - 19 = 16 games. Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack these remaining games, with each box holding 8 games. To find this, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold, which is 16 / 8 = 2. Therefore, Edward needs to use 2 boxes to pack the remaining games.\nTherefore, the answer is (2).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe store initially had 40 coloring books. After putting 20 of them on sale, they were left with 40 - 20 = 20 coloring books. These remaining 20 books were then organized onto shelves with 4 books each. To find out how many shelves were used, we divide the total number of remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 20 / 4 = 5. Therefore, 5 shelves were used to store the remaining books.\nTherefore, the answer is (5).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nEdward initially had 35 games and sold 19 of them. To find out how many games are left, we subtract the number of games sold from the total number of games he originally had, which is 35 - 19 = 16 games. Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack these remaining games, with each box holding 8 games. To find this, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold, which is 16 / 8 = 2. Therefore, Edward needs to use 2 boxes to pack the remaining games.\nTherefore, the answer is (2).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how much money he actually earned, we need to subtract the number of lawns he forgot to mow from the total number of lawns he was supposed to mow. 6 - 2 = 4 lawns.\n\nNext, we can find out how much money Edward earned for each lawn he mowed by dividing the total number of lawns he mowed by the number of dollars he earned per lawn. 4 lawns / 9 dollars per lawn = 0.46 (or 46 cents).\n\nTherefore, Edward actually earned 46 cents for the 4 lawns he mowed.", 'true_answer': [36.0]}

A librarian takes 10 books, leaving Oliver with 36 books to shelve. The capacity of each shelf is 4 books. To find out how many shelves Oliver needs, divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold: 36 books / 4 books per shelf = 9 shelves.

These remaining 20 books were then organized onto shelves with 4 books each.

To find out how many games are left, we subtract the number of games sold from the total number of games he originally had, which is 35 - 19 = 16 games. Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack these remaining games, with each box holding 8 games. To find this, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold, which is 16 / 8 = 2.

If a group of 9 people came in, and 2 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?\n\nA: Let's break this down step by step. If each adult meal costs $2, then the total cost for 9 adult meals would be 9 x $2 = $18. However, since 2 of the people are kids, they eat for free, so we subtract the cost of those meals from the total. $18 - $0 = $18. Therefore, it would cost $18 for the group to eat.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (18).", 'true_answer': [14.0]}

If Paige scored 11 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. If Paige scored 11 points and everyone else scored 6 points each, that means the total number of points scored by Paige's team is 11 + (6 x number of players) = 11 + 36 = 47 points. Since the team scored 41 points total, that means there are 41 - 47 = -6 points left over.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many players were on Paige's team. To do this, we can divide the total number of points scored by the number of points scored by each player: -6 / 6 = -1.

Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of tickets Haley purchased by adding the 3 tickets she bought for herself and her friends to the 5 extra tickets, which gives 3 + 5 = 8 tickets. Next, determine the total cost by multiplying the number of tickets (8) by the cost per ticket (4 dollars), which results in 8 * 4 = 32 dollars. Therefore, Haley spent a total of 32 dollars on tickets.\nTherefore, the answer is (32).\n\nQuestion:  Emily was planting vegetables in her garden.
