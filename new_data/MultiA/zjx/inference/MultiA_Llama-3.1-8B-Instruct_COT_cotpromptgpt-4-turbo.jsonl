First, let's find out how many hours it took to paint 8 rooms. Since each room takes 8 hours to paint, we multiply the number of rooms by the hours per room: 8 rooms * 8 hours/room = 64 hours.\n\n2. Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take to paint the remaining 2 rooms. Since each room takes 8 hours to paint, we multiply the number of remaining rooms by the hours per room: 2 rooms * 8 hours/room = 16 hours.\n\n3. Since the painter has already spent 64 hours painting 8 rooms, we need to find out how many hours he has left to paint the remaining 2 rooms. We subtract the hours already spent from the total hours needed to paint the remaining rooms: 16 hours - 0 hours (since he hasn't started painting the remaining rooms yet) = 16 hours.\n\n4. However, we need to find out how many hours he will take to paint the remaining 2 rooms. Since he has already spent 64 hours, we need to add the hours he will take to paint the remaining 2 rooms to the hours he has already spent. So, the total hours he will take to paint the remaining 2 rooms is 16 hours.\n\n5. Since the painter has already spent 64 hours, we need to add the hours he will take to paint the remaining 2 rooms to the hours he has already spent. So, the total hours he will take to paint the remaining 2 rooms is 64 + 16 = 80 hours.\n\n6. However, we need to find out how many hours he will take to paint the remaining 2 rooms. Since he has already spent 64 hours, we need to find out how many hours he will take to paint the remaining 2 rooms. We already know that it will take him 16 hours to paint the remaining 2 rooms.\n\n7. Since the painter has already painted 8 rooms, we need to find out how many rooms are left to paint. We subtract the rooms already painted from the total number of rooms: 10 rooms - 8 rooms = 2 rooms.\n\n8. Since each room takes 8 hours to paint, we multiply the number of remaining rooms by the hours per room: 2 rooms * 8 hours/room = 16 hours.\n\n9. Since the painter has already spent 64 hours painting 8 rooms, we need to find out how many hours he has left to paint the remaining 2 rooms. We subtract the hours already spent from the total hours needed to paint the remaining rooms: 16 hours - 0 hours (since he hasn't started painting the remaining rooms yet) = 16 hours.\n\n10.
