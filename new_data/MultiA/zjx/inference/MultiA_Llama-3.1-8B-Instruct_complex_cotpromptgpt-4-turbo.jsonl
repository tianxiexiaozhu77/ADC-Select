She uploaded 7 pictures from her phone and 13 from her camera, which totals 7 + 13 = 20 pictures. Next, we know she sorted these pictures into 5 different albums, and each album has the same amount of pictures.

However, since the question asks for the number of extra apples, we can assume that the cafeteria gave each student 1 apple (since we don't have any information about the distribution). \n\nIf 42 students got 1 apple each, the cafeteria gave away 42 apples. To find out how many apples are left, we subtract the number of apples given away from the total number of apples: 51 - 42 = 9 apples.\n\nTherefore, the cafeteria ended up with 9 extra apples.", 'true_answer': [9.0]}
