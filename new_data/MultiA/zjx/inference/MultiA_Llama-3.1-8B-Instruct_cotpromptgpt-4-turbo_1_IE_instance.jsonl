That is, 25 - 11 = 14 playable records.\nTherefore, the answer is (14)\n\nQuestion:  At the arcade, Tom won 32 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 25 tickets playing 'skee ball'. If he spent 7 of his tickets on a hat, how many tickets does Tom have left? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "To find out how many tickets Tom has left, we need to add the tickets he won from both games and then subtract the tickets he spent on a hat. \n\nFirst, let's add the tickets he won: 32 (from 'whack a mole') + 25 (from'skee ball') = 57 tickets.\n\nThen, we subtract the tickets he spent on a hat: 57 - 7 = 50 tickets.\n\nTherefore, Tom has 50 tickets left.", 'true_answer': [50.0]}

So, Luke will make 5 trips to pick up the trays from the first table.\n\nFor the second table with 16 trays, we divide 16 by 4. 16 divided by 4 equals 4. So, Luke will make 4 trips to pick up the trays from the second table.\n\nTo find the total number of trips, we add the trips from both tables together. 5 (trips from the first table) + 4 (trips from the second table) equals 9. Therefore, the answer is 9.', 'true_answer': [9.0]}

Next, we need to determine how many bouquets can be made if each bouquet consists of 5 roses. To do this, we divide the total number of roses by the number of roses per bouquet: 75 roses / 5 roses per bouquet = 15 bouquets. Thus, the florist can make 15 bouquets with the available roses.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQuestion:  Wendy picked 103 flowers for her friend’s wedding.

How many full trays can she still line up?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst we'll calculate how many cupcakes Sarah had left after dropping some. She originally had 102 cupcakes and dropped some leaving her with 90 cupcakes. Next, we need to figure out how many full trays of 6 cupcakes each she can still line up with the 90 cupcakes left. To do this, divide the number of cupcakes she has left by the number of cupcakes that can fit in a tray. So, 90 cupcakes divided by 6 cupcakes per tray equals 15 trays.

After taking 5 new photos and having 53 old photos, how many album pages did she use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of photos Sarah has by adding her old photos and new photos. She has 53 old photos and she took 5 new ones, so 53 + 5 = 58 photos in total. Each album page can hold 6 photos, so to find the number of pages she used, divide the total number of photos by the number of photos each page can hold. Calculate 58 / 6 = 9.67.
