If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there are 46 books to be shelved. A librarian takes 10 books, leaving Oliver with 36 books to shelve. The capacity of each shelf is 4 books. To find out how many shelves Oliver needs, divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold: 36 books / 4 books per shelf = 9 shelves.

They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe store initially had 40 coloring books. After putting 20 of them on sale, they were left with 40 - 20 = 20 coloring books. These remaining 20 books were then organized onto shelves with 4 books each. To find out how many shelves were used, we divide the total number of remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 20 / 4 = 5. Therefore, 5 shelves were used to store the remaining books.\nTherefore, the answer is (5).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nEdward initially had 35 games and sold 19 of them. To find out how many games are left, we subtract the number of games sold from the total number of games he originally had, which is 35 - 19 = 16 games. Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack these remaining games, with each box holding 8 games. To find this, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold, which is 16 / 8 = 2. Therefore, Edward needs to use 2 boxes to pack the remaining games.\nTherefore, the answer is (2).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of tickets Haley purchased by adding the 3 tickets she bought for herself and her friends to the 5 extra tickets, which gives 3 + 5 = 8 tickets. Next, determine the total cost by multiplying the number of tickets (8) by the cost per ticket (4 dollars), which results in 8 * 4 = 32 dollars. Therefore, Haley spent a total of 32 dollars on tickets.\nTherefore, the answer is (32).\n\nQuestion:  In fourth grade there were 40 students at the start of the year.

If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there are 46 books to be shelved. A librarian takes 10 books, leaving Oliver with 36 books to shelve. The capacity of each shelf is 4 books. To find out how many shelves Oliver needs, divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold: 36 books / 4 books per shelf = 9 shelves.

They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe store initially had 40 coloring books. After putting 20 of them on sale, they were left with 40 - 20 = 20 coloring books. These remaining 20 books were then organized onto shelves with 4 books each. To find out how many shelves were used, we divide the total number of remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 20 / 4 = 5. Therefore, 5 shelves were used to store the remaining books.\nTherefore, the answer is (5).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nEdward initially had 35 games and sold 19 of them. To find out how many games are left, we subtract the number of games sold from the total number of games he originally had, which is 35 - 19 = 16 games. Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack these remaining games, with each box holding 8 games. To find this, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold, which is 16 / 8 = 2. Therefore, Edward needs to use 2 boxes to pack the remaining games.\nTherefore, the answer is (2).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

Katie scored 4 points. Since everyone else scored 4 points each, we can represent the total points scored by the other players as 4x, where x is the number of players. The total points scored by the team is 12, so we can set up the equation: 4 (Katie's points) + 4x (points from other players) = 12. \n\nTo solve for x, we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 12 - 4, which simplifies to 4x = 8. Then, we divide both sides by 4 to find x: x = 8 / 4, which simplifies to x = 2. This means there were 2 other players on Katie's team. Since Katie is also a player, the total number of players on her team is 2 (other players) + 1 (Katie) = 3. Therefore, there were 3 players on Katie's team.", 'true_answer': [2.0]}
