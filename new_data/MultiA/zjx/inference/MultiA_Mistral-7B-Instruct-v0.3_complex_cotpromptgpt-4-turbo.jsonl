There are 46 book to put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with the rest. If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nOliver starts with 46 books. A librarian takes 10 books, leaving Oliver with 46 - 10 = 36 books. Each shelf can hold 4 books. To find out how many shelves are needed, divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold: 36 divided by 4 equals 9. Therefore, Oliver will need 9 shelves to store all the books.\nTherefore, the answer is (9).\n\nQ:  Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 8 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of pictures Olivia uploaded by adding the pictures from her phone and camera. She uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera, so 5 + 35 = 40 pictures in total. Next, since the pictures are sorted into 8 different albums with the same number of pictures in each album, divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. Therefore, 40 pictures divided by 8 albums equals 5 pictures per album.\nTherefore, the answer is (5).\n\nQ:  Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 8 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of pictures Olivia uploaded by adding the pictures from her phone and her camera. This is 5 (from phone) + 35 (from camera) = 40 pictures in total. Next, we are told that these pictures are evenly distributed into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. So, 40 pictures ÷ 8 albums = 5 pictures per album.\nTherefore, the answer is (5).\n\nQuestion:  Rachel bought two coloring books. One had 23 pictures and the other had 32. After one week she had already colored 44 of the pictures. How many pictures does she still have to color? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "First, let's find out how many pictures Rachel has colored from each book. She colored 44 pictures in total, and we know that one book had 23 pictures and the other had 32. So, the number of pictures she colored from the first book is 44 - (number of pictures in the first book) and the number of pictures she colored from the second book is 44 - (number of pictures in the second book).\n\nLet x be the number of pictures in the first book, and y be the number of pictures in the second book. We can write the following equations:\n\nx + y = 55 (total number of pictures in both books)\n44 - x = y (number of pictures she colored from the first book)\n44 - y = x (number of pictures she colored from the second book)\n\nNow, we can solve these equations. First, let's rewrite the second equation as y = 44 - x. Next, substitute this expression for y into the first equation:\n\nx + (44 - x) = 55\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx + 44 - x = 55\n44 = 55\n\nThis equation is not true, so there seems to be a mistake in the question. If the total number of pictures in both books is 55, and Rachel colored 44 pictures, then she should have colored all the pictures, and there would be no pictures left to color. However, if we assume that the total number of pictures in both books is 56 instead, then the question would be correct. In this case, Rachel would have 2 pictures left to color.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (2), assuming the total number of pictures in both books is 56.", 'true_answer': [11.0]}

But, if only 5 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "The school cafeteria ordered a total of 6 red apples + 15 green apples = 21 apples. However, only 5 students wanted fruit, so the cafeteria ended up with 21 apples - (5 students * number of apples per student) = 21 apples - (5 * x) = 21 - 5x, where x is the number of apples per student. Since we don't know the number of apples per student, we can't find the exact number of extra apples. But we can say that the cafeteria ended up with more than 16 apples (21 - 5 = 16), as there were at least 5 students who wanted fruit.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (more than 16).", 'true_answer': [16.0]}

If she sorted the pics into 8 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of pictures Olivia uploaded by adding the pictures from her phone and camera. She uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera, so 5 + 35 = 40 pictures in total. Next, since the pictures are sorted into 8 different albums with the same number of pictures in each album, divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. Therefore, 40 pictures divided by 8 albums equals 5 pictures per album.\nTherefore, the answer is (5).\n\nQ:  Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 8 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of pictures Olivia uploaded by adding the pictures from her phone and her camera. This is 5 (from phone) + 35 (from camera) = 40 pictures in total. Next, we are told that these pictures are evenly distributed into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. So, 40 pictures ÷ 8 albums = 5 pictures per album.\nTherefore, the answer is (5).\n\nQuestion:  The schools debate team had 5 boys and 40 girls on it. If they were split into groups of 9 how many groups could they make? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "First, let's find the total number of students on the debate team. There are 5 boys and 40 girls, so the total number of students is 5 + 40 = 45 students.\n\nNext, we are told that the students are split into groups of 9. To find out how many groups can be made, divide the total number of students by the number of students per group: 45 students ÷ 9 students per group = 5 groups.\n\nHowever, since there are 40 girls and 5 boys, it's impossible to form groups of exactly 9 students without leaving some students out. To make 5 groups of 9 students, we would need 45 students - 4 (the remaining 4 boys) = 41 students. But we only have 40 girls, so it's not possible to form 5 groups of 9 students.\n\nInstead, let's find the maximum number of groups that can be formed with the given number of students. Since there are 40 girls, we can form 4 groups of 10 girls each (40 girls ÷ 10 girls per group = 4 groups). With the remaining 5 students (the 5 boys), we can form 1 more group of 5 students. So, the maximum number of groups that can be formed is 4 + 1 = 5 groups.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (5).", 'true_answer': [5.0]}

Since we cannot have a fraction of a point, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 3 points.\n\nNext, let's find out how many points her friends earned for recycling their paper. They recycled 23 pounds of paper, so we divide the number of pounds they recycled by 8 to find out how many points they earned: 23 ÷ 8 = 2.875 points. Again, since we cannot have a fraction of a point, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 2 points.\n\nFinally, to find out the total number of points earned by Zoe and her friends, we add the points they each earned: 3 points (Zoe) + 2 points (friends) = 5 points in total.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (5).", 'true_answer': [6.0]}

If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "First, we need to find out how many problems Sarah has left to do. She finished 6 problems and has 7 pages left, so the total number of problems she has left is 7 pages * (number of problems per page) + 6 finished problems.\n\nSince we don't know the number of problems per page, we can't find the exact number of problems on each page. However, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of problems per page:\n\n7 pages * (number of problems per page) + 6 = 55\n\nTo find the number of problems per page, we need to isolate the variable (number of problems per page) in the equation. Solving for the number of problems per page would require additional information, such as the number of problems on one of the pages or the total number of problems Sarah had to do.\n\nTherefore, we cannot determine the exact number of problems on each page without more information.\n\nFinal answer: We cannot determine the number of problems on each page without more information.", 'true_answer': [7.0]}
