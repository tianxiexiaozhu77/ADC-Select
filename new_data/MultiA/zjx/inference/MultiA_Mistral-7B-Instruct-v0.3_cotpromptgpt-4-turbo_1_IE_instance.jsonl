Next, determine the number of apples given to the 5 students: Since we don't know the ratio of red to green apples given to each student, let's assume that each student received the same number of apples. So, if 5 students wanted fruit, they would have received a total of 5 students * x apples, where x is the number of apples each student received.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n1) 5 students * x = 5 (since 5 students wanted fruit)\n2) x + 6 red apples + 15 green apples = 21 (total number of apples ordered)\n\nSolving equation 1 for x, we get x = 1. This means that each student received 1 apple.\n\nNow, using this value of x in equation 2, we have:\n1 + 6 red apples + 15 green apples = 21\n6 red apples + 15 green apples = 20\n\nSince we don't know the exact number of red apples, we can't find the exact number of extra apples. However, we do know that there are at least 20 - (6 red apples + 15 green apples) = 20 - (6 + 15) = 9 extra apples.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (At least 9 extra apples)", 'true_answer': [16.0]}

If each vase contained 8 flowers, how many flowers did she have total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst calculate the total number of vases by adding the vases for roses and daisies, which is 6 + 4 = 10 vases. Since each vase contains 8 flowers, multiply the total vases by the number of flowers per vase, which is 10 * 8 = 80. Therefore, Lucy has a total of 80 flowers.\nTherefore, the answer is (80)\n\nQuestion:  A vase can hold 6 flowers. If you had 7 carnations and 47 roses, how many vases would you need to hold the flowers? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "First, let's calculate the total number of flowers. Add the number of carnations and roses, which is 7 + 47 = 54 flowers.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many groups of 6 flowers can be made from the total number of flowers. To do this, divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers each vase can hold, which is 54 / 6. However, since division is not possible with a whole number, we know that we will need to use more than one vase.\n\nTo find out exactly how many vases are needed, we can use the quotient (number of full vases) and the remainder (number of flowers left over). In this case, the quotient is 54 / 6 = 9 (nine full vases), and the remainder is 54 % 6 = 4 (four flowers left over).\n\nSince we cannot fit the four leftover flowers into a vase that holds 6 flowers, we will need an additional vase to hold those flowers. So, in total, we need 9 vases for the full groups and 1 vase for the leftover flowers, making a total of 10 vases.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (10) vases.", 'true_answer': [9.0]}

Next, given that one shelf can hold up to 11 cups, we divide the total number of cups (64) by the number of cups per shelf (11).

If 8 of them got a role, how many did not make it into the play?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many children did not get a role in the play, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of children who tried out and the number who were selected. There were 30 children who tried out, and 8 children got a role. By subtracting the number of children who got a role from the total number that tried out, we get the number of children who did not make it into the play.

If 8 of them got a role, how many did not make it into the play?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many children did not get a role in the play, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of children who tried out and the number who were selected. There were 30 children who tried out, and 8 children got a role. By subtracting the number of children who got a role from the total number that tried out, we get the number of children who did not make it into the play. So, the calculation is 30 (total children) - 8 (children who got a role) = 22.\nTherefore, the answer is (22)\n\nQuestion:  There were 8 friends playing a video game online when 5 players quit.

Then, since each of these 3 customers tipped $9 each, you multiply the number of tipping customers (3) by the tip amount ($9 each) to find the total amount of tip received. 3 customers * $9 each = $27.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the waiter still needs to account for the 4 customers who didn't leave a tip. Since they didn't tip, the waiter didn't earn any money from them. So, the total amount of money the waiter earned is the amount he received from the tipping customers ($27) minus the number of customers who didn't tip (4) multiplied by the average amount he would have earned per customer if they had all tipped (since we don't know the average tip amount, we can't calculate this exactly, but we can say that the waiter would have earned less than $9 per customer if they had all tipped, so let's assume the average tip amount is $5 for simplicity).\n\nSo, the total amount of money the waiter earned is $27 - (4 * $5) = $27 - $20 = $7.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (7) dollars.", 'true_answer': [27.0]}

She put 11 pics into one album and put the rest into 8 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "First, let's find out how many pictures are left after Nancy put 11 pictures into one album. She uploaded 51 pictures, and she put 11 into one album, so 51 - 11 = 40 pictures are left.\n\nNow, we know that Nancy put the rest of the pictures into 8 different albums. Since there are 40 pictures left and she made 8 albums, we can divide the remaining pictures by the number of albums to find out how many pictures are in each album. Calculate 40 / 8 = 5.\n\nHowever, since we cannot have a fraction of a picture, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, each of the 8 albums contains 6 pictures (the 5 from the calculation) plus one extra picture, making it 7 pictures in each of the 8 albums.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (7 pictures per album).", 'true_answer': [5.0]}

{'question': " Sarah baked 38 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 14 of them how many packages could she make if she put 8 cupcake in each package? ", 'idx': 598, 'prompt': "Q: Sarah prepared 102 cupcakes for a bake sale. She needed to place them in trays of 6 each. After accidentally dropping some, she had 90 cupcakes left. How many full trays can she still line up?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst we'll calculate how many cupcakes Sarah had left after dropping some. She originally had 102 cupcakes and dropped some leaving her with 90 cupcakes. Next, we need to figure out how many full trays of 6 cupcakes each she can still line up with the 90 cupcakes left. To do this, divide the number of cupcakes she has left by the number of cupcakes that can fit in a tray. So, 90 cupcakes divided by 6 cupcakes per tray equals 15 trays. Thus, she can line up 15 full trays with the cupcakes remaining.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQuestion:  Sarah baked 38 cupcakes for her school's bake sale.

{'question': ' Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook. She put 37 pics into one album and put the rest into 2 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? ', 'idx': 599, 'prompt': "Q: Sarah was placing her photographs in an album with 6 photos on each page. After taking 5 new photos and having 53 old photos, how many album pages did she use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of photos Sarah has by adding her old photos and new photos. She has 53 old photos and she took 5 new ones, so 53 + 5 = 58 photos in total. Each album page can hold 6 photos, so to find the number of pages she used, divide the total number of photos by the number of photos each page can hold. Calculate 58 / 6 = 9.67. Since she can't use a fraction of a page, round up to the next whole number, which is 10. Therefore, Sarah used 10 full pages to hold all her photos.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQuestion:  Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook. She put 37 pics into one album and put the rest into 2 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "First, let's find out how many pictures are left after Nancy put 37 pictures into one album. She uploaded 41 pictures in total, so 41 - 37 = 4 pictures are left.\n\nSince these 4 pictures are put into 2 different albums, we can divide the remaining pictures by 2 to find out how many pictures are in each of the 2 albums. Calculate 4 / 2 = 2.\n\nHowever, since we can't have a fraction of an album, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, since 2 is already a whole number, we don't need to round up. So, each of the 2 remaining albums contains 2 pictures.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (2, 2) for the number of pictures in each album.", 'true_answer': [2.0]}
