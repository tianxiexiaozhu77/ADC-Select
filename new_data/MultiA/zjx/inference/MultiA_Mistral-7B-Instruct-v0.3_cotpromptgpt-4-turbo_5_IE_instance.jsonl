Subtract the number of interested customers from the total toys available to find how many extra toys the store ended up with. 145 toys minus 120 interested customers equals 25 extra toys.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: A pet store purchased 30 bags of dog food and 15 bags of cat food for a big sale. If only 5 customers bought food, how many extra bags did the store end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe pet store initially purchased 30 bags of dog food and 15 bags of cat food, making a total of 45 bags. With only 5 customers purchasing food, the average number of bags per customer would be 45 bags divided by 5 customers, which equals 9 bags per customer. To calculate the extra bags, we need to know how many bags each customer bought, which is not supplied in the problem. It might be assumed that all customers collectively bought all the bags if no extra bags are mentioned explicitly. Therefore, the store may not have ended up with any extra bags.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: A pet shop got 46 bags of dog food and 39 bags of cat food for sale, but if only 60 bags were sold, how many did they have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of bags of food available in the pet shop by adding the number of bags of dog food and cat food. This gives us 46 bags of dog food plus 39 bags of cat food, which equals 85 bags in total. We are then told that only 60 bags were sold. To find out how many bags are left, we subtract the number of bags sold from the total number of bags available. This calculation is 85 total bags minus 60 bags sold, giving us 25 bags remaining.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQuestion:  A pet store had 19 siamese cats and 45 house cats.

If only 4 people showed interest, how many extra books did the library end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of books ordered by the library. This is done by adding the number of new books and old books ordered: 57 (new books) + 45 (old books) = 102 books in total. Next, divide this number by the number of people who showed interest to determine how many books each person would need if they were to distribute evenly: 102 books / 4 people = 25.5 books per person. Since it's unlikely the books were cut in half and given out, we assume each person gets 25 books, meaning 4 * 25 = 100 books are distributed. Therefore, the library ends up with 102 total ordered - 100 distributed = 2 extra books.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQuestion:  A book store had 41 books in the bargin bin.

Next, consider that each bouquet purchased represents a combination of roses and tulips. If 125 bouquets were sold and assuming a worst-case scenario each bouquet used at least 1 flower, 125 flowers in total would be used. If each bouquet used at least 3 flowers, 375 flowers would be used, which exceeds the total prepared, leading to zero extra flowers with a practical bouquet composition.

How many extra flowers did the shop end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, sum the total flowers prepared by the shop: 200 roses + 150 tulips = 350 flowers. Next, consider that each bouquet purchased represents a combination of roses and tulips. If 125 bouquets were sold and assuming a worst-case scenario each bouquet used at least 1 flower, 125 flowers in total would be used. If each bouquet used at least 3 flowers, 375 flowers would be used, which exceeds the total prepared, leading to zero extra flowers with a practical bouquet composition. It's safe to assume that each bouquet uses at least 2 to 3 flowers and thus all 350 flowers would adequately be accounted for in 125 bouquets.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: A nursery purchased 90 roses and 70 tulips for a special event.

With only 5 customers purchasing food, the average number of bags per customer would be 45 bags divided by 5 customers, which equals 9 bags per customer. To calculate the extra bags, we need to know how many bags each customer bought, which is not supplied in the problem.

If they were organized into groups of 10, how many groups could be made?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of participants in the projects. For 18 projects with each having 3 participants, there are 18 * 3 = 54 participants. For 6 projects with each having 2 participants, there are 6 * 2 = 12 participants. So, the total number of participants is 54 + 12 = 66. Then, divide the total number of participants by the number of participants per group to find the number of groups. 66 participants divided into groups of 10 gives 66 / 10 = 6.6. Since a group cannot have a fraction of a person, and you typically can't have a group with fewer than the set number per group in this context, only 6 full groups of 10 can be formed. The remaining 6 participants are not enough to form an additional group of 10.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: In the school play audition, there were 5 girls and 6 boys participating.

If they were organized into groups of 10, how many groups could be made?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of participants in the projects. For 18 projects with each having 3 participants, there are 18 * 3 = 54 participants. For 6 projects with each having 2 participants, there are 6 * 2 = 12 participants. So, the total number of participants is 54 + 12 = 66. Then, divide the total number of participants by the number of participants per group to find the number of groups. 66 participants divided into groups of 10 gives 66 / 10 = 6.6. Since a group cannot have a fraction of a person, and you typically can't have a group with fewer than the set number per group in this context, only 6 full groups of 10 can be formed. The remaining 6 participants are not enough to form an additional group of 10.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: During a charity fun run event, there were 36 boys and 48 girls participating.

If 2 cows are sold each day, how long would it take for all of them to be sold?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the farmer had 4 cows. After purchasing another 16, the total number of cows became 4 + 16 = 20.

If they split into 8 teams how many people would be on each team? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': 'First, calculate the total number of participants in the volleyball game by adding the number of managers and employees: \\(9 + 15 = 24\\). Then, since the participants are organized into 8 teams, divide the total number of participants by the number of teams to determine how many participants each team will have: \\(24 \\div 8 = 3\\). However, since volleyball is typically played with 6 players per team, we need to adjust our calculation.\n\nTo find the number of teams that can be formed with 6 players each, divide the total number of participants by the number of players per team: \\(24 \\div 6 = 4\\). Since we want to form 8 teams, we need to find a way to add more players to the teams without exceeding 6 players per team.\n\nTo do this, we can add an extra player to each of the first 4 teams, making them 7-player teams, and then form the remaining 4 teams with 6 players each. The total number of players in the 8 teams would be:\n\n(4 teams with 7 players each) * (7 players) + (4 teams with 6 players each) * (6 players) = 28 + 24 = 52 players\n\nHowever, we started with only 24 players. To account for this discrepancy, we can assume that some players may be able to play on more than one team, or that some players may not show up for the game. In this case, we would need to adjust the number of players per team accordingly to ensure that all teams have the required number of players.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the number of people on each team would depend on the number of players available and the number of teams that need to be formed. Without additional information, it is not possible to provide a specific number for the number of people on each team.', 'true_answer': [3.0]}

If John purchased 4 action figures and 2 dolls, how much did he spend?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of toys John bought, which includes both action figures and dolls. John purchased 4 action figures and 2 dolls, making a total of 4 + 2 = 6 toys.

First, for the fiction section with 21 books, since John can carry 7 books at a time: 21 books divided by 7 books per trip equals 3 trips. Next, for the non-fiction section with 29 books, dividing this by 7 gives about 4.14, which means he actually needs to make 5 trips (because he can't make a fraction of a trip and he needs an additional trip for the remaining books). Therefore, total trips = trips for fiction + trips for non-fiction = 3 + 5 = 8.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: Each book in a pile costs $5.

Each adult coffee is $5. So, the total cost for the adult coffees is 3 adults times $5 each, which equals $15. Since children's hot chocolate is free, there is no additional cost for the 7 children's drinks. Adding the costs together, the total cost for the group’s drinks is just for the adult coffees which is $15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQuestion:  At a restaurant each adult meal costs $7 and kids eat free.

The problem states that there are 15 people in total and 10 of them are kids. The number of adults is 15 - 10 = 5. Each adult burger costs $8, so the cost for the adult burgers is 5 adults x $8/adult = $40. Since kid's meals are free, there is no cost associated with the 10 kids' meals. Adding the costs gives us a total cost of $40 for the adults' meals only, as the kids' meals are free.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: In a fast food joint, each burger costs $4 and fries come free.

If a group of 10 people visited and 7 were children, how much would it cost for the group to have their drinks?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, evaluate the number of adults in the group, which is 10 total people minus 7 children, giving 3 adults. Each adult coffee is $5. So, the total cost for the adult coffees is 3 adults times $5 each, which equals $15. Since children's hot chocolate is free, there is no additional cost for the 7 children's drinks.

If a party of 15 comes in and 10 are kids, what would be the total cost for the party to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total cost of the meals for the party, we need to determine the number of adults and children. The problem states that there are 15 people in total and 10 of them are kids. The number of adults is 15 - 10 = 5. Each adult burger costs $8, so the cost for the adult burgers is 5 adults x $8/adult = $40. Since kid's meals are free, there is no cost associated with the 10 kids' meals. Adding the costs gives us a total cost of $40 for the adults' meals only, as the kids' meals are free.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: At a buffet, each adult entry fee is $10 and kids under 5 eat free.

Each adult plate costs $6, hence, the total cost for all adult plates is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per plate, which is 8 * $6 = $48. Since salads are free for kids, there is no additional cost for the 12 kids.

{'question': ' At a restaurant each adult meal costs $8 and kids eat free. If a group of 11 people came in and 2 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat? ', 'idx': 483, 'prompt': "Q: In a cafeteria, each adult plate costs $6 and salad is free for kids. If a group of 20 people came in and 12 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, determine the number of adults and children in the group from the total of 20 people, with 12 being kids, it follows that there are 8 adults. Each adult plate costs $6, hence, the total cost for all adult plates is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per plate, which is 8 * $6 = $48. Since salads are free for kids, there is no additional cost for the 12 kids.

If a group of 12 people visited and 7 of them were children, how much would it cost for the group to drink?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much it would cost for the group to drink, we need to calculate the total cost of drinks for the adults only, since children's hot chocolate is free. Given that each adult coffee costs $3, we first determine how many adults are in the group. From a total of 12 people, 7 of them are children, so there are 12 - 7 = 5 adults. The total cost for the adults' coffee is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per coffee: 5 adults * $3 per coffee = $15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: At a diner each adult burger costs $8 while a kid's meal is free. If a party of 15 comes in and 10 are kids, what would be the total cost for the party to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total cost of the meals for the party, we need to determine the number of adults and children. The problem states that there are 15 people in total and 10 of them are kids. The number of adults is 15 - 10 = 5. Each adult burger costs $8, so the cost for the adult burgers is 5 adults x $8/adult = $40. Since kid's meals are free, there is no cost associated with the 10 kids' meals. Adding the costs gives us a total cost of $40 for the adults' meals only, as the kids' meals are free.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: In a fast food joint, each burger costs $4 and fries come free. If a party of 15 people entered and 9 were kids who ate fries, how much would it cost for the party?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, identify the number of people who consumed burgers. Since 9 kids ate only fries and there were 15 people in total, the number of people who ate burgers is 15 - 9 = 6. Each burger costs $4, therefore the total cost for burgers is 6 * $4 = $24. Since fries are free, there are no additional costs for the fries. Hence, the total cost for the party is solely from the burgers which is $24.\nTherefore, the answer is (24)\n\nQ: In a cafe each adult coffee costs $5 and children's hot chocolate is free. If a group of 10 people visited and 7 were children, how much would it cost for the group to have their drinks?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, evaluate the number of adults in the group, which is 10 total people minus 7 children, giving 3 adults. Each adult coffee is $5. So, the total cost for the adult coffees is 3 adults times $5 each, which equals $15. Since children's hot chocolate is free, there is no additional cost for the 7 children's drinks. Adding the costs together, the total cost for the group’s drinks is just for the adult coffees which is $15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQuestion:  At a restaurant each adult meal costs $8 and kids eat free.

If a party of 15 people entered and 9 were kids who ate fries, how much would it cost for the party?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, identify the number of people who consumed burgers. Since 9 kids ate only fries and there were 15 people in total, the number of people who ate burgers is 15 - 9 = 6. Each burger costs $4, therefore the total cost for burgers is 6 * $4 = $24.

Each adult plate costs $6, hence, the total cost for all adult plates is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per plate, which is 8 * $6 = $48. Since salads are free for kids, there is no additional cost for the 12 kids. Thus, the total cost for the group to eat is simply the cost of the adult plates.\nTherefore, the answer is (48)\n\nQ: In a cafe each adult coffee costs $5 and children's hot chocolate is free.

To do this, we divide the remaining 3 books by the number of books that can fit on a shelf (4), which gives us a fraction of a shelf. Since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 1.\n\nSo, Oliver will need 9 full shelves and 1 additional shelf to accommodate all the books.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (10) shelves.', 'true_answer': [9.0]}

So, 30 divided by 3 equals 10 players per team.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: 64 students applied for the basketball team. If 14 of them were not successful and the remaining were organized into 5 groups, how many students would each group include?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know the total number of students who applied is 64. Out of them, 14 were not successful in getting into the team, so they do not count towards the team's final number. So we subtract 14 from 64, which leaves us with 50 students who made the team. These 50 students were further divided into 5 groups. To find out how many students each group includes, we divide the total number of successful students by the number of groups. So, 50 divided by 5 equals 10. Hence, each group includes 10 students.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: There are 120 kids signed up for a summer camp.

The total points scored by the team were 66. So, the points scored by others were 66 - 42 = 24 points. Assuming everyone else scored 3 points each, we divide the remaining points by 3 to find the number of other players. That is 24 / 3 = 8 players. Including Luke, the total number of players on the team is 8 + 1 = 9.\nTherefore, the answer is (9)\n\nQuestion:  Bianca's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total.

Next, since each of the other players scored 6 points, we divide the total points scored by the other players by the points each player scored to find the number of other players: 30 / 6 = 5 players.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a mistake in the question. If everyone else scored 6 points each, and there are 5 players, the total points scored by the other players would be 5 * 6 = 30 points, which is the same as the total points scored by the team minus Bianca's points. This means that Bianca scored an additional point, making the total points scored by the team 76.\n\nIn this case, the total number of players on Bianca's team would be 6 (the other 5 players) + 1 (Bianca) = 7 players.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (7).", 'true_answer': [5.0]}
