So, the number of books Oliver has to put away is:\n   \\[\n   46 - 10 = 36\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed:**\n   Oliver can fit 4 books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  Faye and her mom were picking carrots from their garden.

If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves Oliver will need, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of books Oliver has to put away:**\n   The total number of books is 46, and the librarian takes 10 of them. So, the number of books Oliver has to put away is:\n   \\[\n   46 - 10 = 36\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed:**\n   Oliver can fit 4 books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games.

If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves Oliver will need, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of books Oliver has to put away:**\n   The total number of books is 46, and the librarian takes 10 of them. So, the number of books Oliver has to put away is:\n   \\[\n   46 - 10 = 36\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed:**\n   Oliver can fit 4 books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.

Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  Adam had 33 books.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  A teacher had 29 worksheets to grade.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  Roger had 25 books. If he sold 21 of them and used the money he earned to buy 30 new books, how many books would Roger have? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': 'To determine how many books Roger would have after selling some and buying new ones, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of books Roger sold:**\n   Roger had 25 books and sold 21 of them.\n   \\[\n   25 - 21 = 4\n   \\]\n   So, Roger sold 4 books.\n\n2. **Calculate the money Roger earned from selling the books:**\n   Each book sold for an unknown amount, but we know that Roger used the money he earned to buy 30 new books. Let x be the price per book. Then, the total amount of money Roger earned is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times x\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the cost of the new books:**\n   Roger bought 30 new books at an unknown price per book. Let y be the price per book. Then, the total cost of the new books is:\n   \\[\n   30 \\times y\n   \\]\n\n4. **Equate the total amount of money Roger earned to the total cost of the new books:**\n   Since Roger used the money he earned to buy the new books, we have:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times x = 30 \\times y\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for the number of books Roger has after buying the new ones:**\n   To find the number of books Roger has after buying the new ones, we first need to solve for x and y in terms of each other. Dividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{30}{4} \\times y\n   \\]\n   Now, we can express y in terms of x:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{4}{30} \\times x\n   \\]\n   Since each new book costs y dollars, the number of books Roger has after buying the new ones is:\n   \\[\n   25 - 4 + \\frac{30}{x}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Find the number of books Roger has after buying the new ones:**\n   To find the number of books Roger has after buying the new ones, we need to know the price per book (x). Without knowing the price per book, we cannot find the exact number of books Roger has. However, we can express the number of books in terms of x:\n   \\[\n   25 - 4 + \\frac{30}{x}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of books Roger would have after selling some and buying new ones is \\(\\boxed{25 - 4 + \\frac{30}{x}}\\).', 'true_answer': [34.0]}

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves Oliver will need, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of books Oliver has to put away:**\n   The total number of books is 46, and the librarian takes 10 of them. So, the number of books Oliver has to put away is:\n   \\[\n   46 - 10 = 36\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed:**\n   Oliver can fit 4 books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.

How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  The schools debate team had 11 boys and 45 girls on it. If they were split into groups of 7 how many groups could they make? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': 'To determine how many groups the debate team could make, we need to find out how many groups can be formed with 7 members each.\n\n1. **Calculate the total number of students on the debate team:**\n   The debate team has 11 boys and 45 girls, for a total of 56 students.\n\n2. **Determine how many groups can be made with 7 students each:**\n   To find out how many groups can be made, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:\n   \\[\n   56 \\div 7 = 8\n   \\]\n   However, since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. So, the debate team can make \\(\\boxed{8}\\) groups with 7 students each.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula for combinations to find the number of ways to choose 7 students from a group of 56:\n\\[\n\\binom{56}{7} = \\frac{56!}{7!(56-7)!} = \\frac{56 \\times 55 \\times 54 \\times 53 \\times 52 \\times 51 \\times 50}{7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 10,792,528\n\\]\nSince we are looking for the number of groups, not the number of ways to choose the students, we divide the number of combinations by the number of ways to arrange the 7 students within the group:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\binom{56}{7}}{7!} = \\frac{10,792,528}{5,040} = 2,145,882\n\\]\nAgain, since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, the debate team can make \\(\\boxed{2,145,882}\\) groups with 7 students each. However, this is an impractical number for our purposes, so we use the simpler method of dividing by 7 to get the number of groups.', 'true_answer': [8.0]}

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.

They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

So, the number of books Oliver has to put away is:\n   \\[\n   46 - 10 = 36\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed:**\n   Oliver can fit 4 books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  Debby's class is going on a field trip to the zoo.

They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  Each chocolate bar in a box cost $3. If a box had 7 bars total and Olivia sold all but 4 bars, how much money would she have made? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "To determine how much money Olivia made from selling the chocolate bars, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of chocolate bars Olivia sold.\n2. Determine the cost of the unsold chocolate bars.\n3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the chocolate bars.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of chocolate bars Olivia sold. She sold all but 4 bars, so the number of chocolate bars she sold is:\n\\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the cost of the unsold chocolate bars. Each chocolate bar costs $3, so the cost of the unsold bars is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the chocolate bars. Since Olivia sold 3 bars, the total revenue is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the cost of the unsold chocolate bars from the total revenue to find out how much money Olivia made:\n\\[ 9 - 12 = -3 \\]\n\nHowever, since it's not possible to have a negative amount of money, it seems there might be a mistake in the question. If Olivia sold all but 4 chocolate bars, she should have made a profit, not a loss. It's possible that the number of unsold chocolate bars was incorrect or that the question was not stated clearly.\n\nIn any case, the correct answer to this question would be the total revenue from selling the chocolate bars, which is \\(\\boxed{9}\\) dollars. But as mentioned earlier, there seems to be a mistake in the question, so this answer should be treated with caution.", 'true_answer': [9.0]}

How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box.

Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  Adam earned 9 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 12 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 8 of them, how much money did he actually earn? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "To determine how much money Adam actually earned, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of lawns Adam mowed.\n2. Determine the earnings for these lawns.\n3. Calculate the number of lawns he didn't mow.\n4. Determine the earnings he lost by not mowing these lawns.\n5. Subtract the lost earnings from the total earnings to find out how much he actually earned.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of lawns Adam mowed. He had 12 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 8 of them. So, the number of lawns he mowed is:\n\\[ 12 - 8 = 4 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the earnings for these lawns. Adam earns $9 for each lawn he mows. So, the earnings for the mowed lawns are:\n\\[ 4 \\times 9 = 36 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of lawns he didn't mow. He forgot to mow 8 of them.\n\nNext, we need to determine the earnings he lost by not mowing these lawns. Since he earns $9 for each lawn he mows, the earnings he lost are:\n\\[ 8 \\times 9 = 72 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the lost earnings from the total earnings to find out how much he actually earned:\n\\[ 36 - 72 = -36 \\]\n\nHowever, since Adam can't lose negative money, it means he didn't earn anything from mowing the lawns. So, Adam actually earned \\(\\boxed{0}\\) dollars.", 'true_answer': [36.0]}

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  At lunch a waiter had 10 customers and 5 of them didn't leave a tip. If he got $3 each from the ones who did tip, how much money did he earn? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "To determine how much money the waiter earned, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of customers who left a tip.\n2. Determine the amount of money received from the customers who left a tip.\n3. Subtract the amount of money not received from the customers who didn't leave a tip.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of customers who left a tip. There were 10 customers in total, and 5 of them didn't leave a tip. So, the number of customers who left a tip is:\n\\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total amount of money received from the customers who left a tip. Each customer who left a tip gave $3. Therefore, the total amount of money received is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\]\n\nFinally, we need to subtract the amount of money not received from the customers who didn't leave a tip. Since we don't know the exact amount of money not received, we can't calculate the total amount of money earned. However, we know that the waiter received $15 from the customers who left a tip.\n\nTherefore, the waiter earned \\(\\boxed{15}\\) dollars from the customers who left a tip, but we don't have enough information to determine the total amount of money he earned.", 'true_answer': [15.0]}

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games.

Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  Edward earned 4 dollars for each lawn he mowed.

He had 17 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 9 of them. So, the number of lawns he mowed is:\n\\[ 17 - 9 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the earnings for these lawns. Each lawn earns Edward $4. Therefore, the earnings for the mowed lawns are:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of lawns Edward didn't mow. He forgot to mow 9 of them.\n\nNext, we need to determine the earnings he lost by not mowing these lawns. Each lawn earns Edward $4. Therefore, the lost earnings are:\n\\[ 9 \\times 4 = 36 \\]\n\nFinally, we subtract the lost earnings from the total earnings to find the actual earnings:\n\\[ 32 - 36 = -4 \\]\n\nHowever, since Edward can't earn a negative amount of money, it means he didn't earn anything from mowing the lawns. So, the actual earnings are \\(\\boxed{0}\\).", 'true_answer': [32.0]}

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  At lunch a waiter had 7 customers and 5 of them didn't leave a tip. If he got $3 each from the ones who did tip, how much money did he earn? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "To determine how much money the waiter earned, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of customers who left a tip:**\n   The waiter had 7 customers, and 5 of them didn't leave a tip. So, the number of customers who left a tip is:\n   \\[\n   7 - 5 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, 2 customers left a tip.\n\n2. **Determine the amount of money earned from tips:**\n   The waiter got $3 from each customer who left a tip. Since 2 customers left a tip, the total amount of money earned from tips is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 3 = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the waiter earned $6 from tips.\n\n3. **Calculate the total amount of money earned:**\n   To find the total amount of money earned, we add the amount earned from tips to the amount the waiter would have earned if all customers had paid for their meals (assuming the cost of the meals is not given):\n   \\[\n   6 + 0 = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the waiter earned \\(\\boxed{6}\\) dollars in total.", 'true_answer': [6.0]}

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock.

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  Sarah had 60 homework problems.

Calculate the total number of problems Sarah still has to do.\n2. Determine the number of pages Sarah has left to complete.\n3. Divide the remaining number of problems by the number of pages to find the number of problems on each page.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of problems Sarah still has to do. She finished 20 problems and has 5 pages left. Since each page has the same number of problems, we can assume that the remaining 5 pages have the same number of problems as the first page Sarah completed (which had 20 problems subtracted). So, the total number of problems Sarah still has to do is:\n\\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of pages Sarah has left to complete. Since Sarah has 5 pages left, the number of pages she has already completed is:\n\\[ 60 - 5 = 55 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the number of problems on each page by dividing the remaining number of problems by the number of pages:\n\\[ \\frac{40}{5} = 8 \\]\n\nSo, each page has \\(\\boxed{8}\\) problems.", 'true_answer': [8.0]}

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  A waiter had 22 customers in his section. If 14 of them left and the rest of his tables had 4 people at each table, how many tables did he have? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': 'To determine how many tables the waiter had, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of customers who remained after some left:**\n   The waiter had 22 customers in his section, and 14 of them left.\n   \\[\n   22 - 14 = 8\n   \\]\n   So, there are 8 customers remaining.\n\n2. **Determine how many tables are needed to seat the remaining customers:**\n   Each table has 4 people. To find out how many tables are needed, we divide the number of remaining customers by the number of people per table:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8}{4} = 2\n   \\]\n   So, the waiter needs 2 tables to seat the remaining customers.\n\nHowever, we also need to account for the tables that the 14 customers who left were sitting at. Since each table has 4 people, the number of tables occupied by the customers who left is:\n\\[\n\\frac{14}{4} = 3.5\n\\]\nSince we cannot have half a table, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4 tables.\n\nNow, we add the number of tables needed for the remaining customers to the number of tables occupied by the customers who left:\n\\[\n2 + 4 = 6\n\\]\nTherefore, the waiter had \\(\\boxed{6}\\) tables in his section.', 'true_answer': [2.0]}

Calculate the total points scored by everyone else on the team.\n2. Determine the number of players on the team.\n\nFirst, let's find the total points scored by everyone else on the team. Since everyone else scored 6 points each, and Bianca scored 45 points, the total points scored by everyone else is:\n\\[ (12) \\times 6 = 72 \\]\n\nNow, we know that the total points scored by Bianca's team was 75 points, and the total points scored by everyone else was 72 points. So, the total points scored by Bianca herself is:\n\\[ 75 - 72 = 3 \\]\nHowever, since Bianca scored 45 points, there must have been an error in the question. Let's assume that Bianca scored 3 points instead.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of players on the team. Since everyone else scored 6 points each, and the total points scored by everyone else was 72 points, the number of players on the team (excluding Bianca) is:\n\\[ \\frac{72}{6} = 12 \\]\n\nSince we know that Bianca scored 3 points, the total number of points scored by the team is:\n\\[ 12 \\times 6 + 3 = 75 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of players on Bianca's team is \\(\\boxed{13}\\) (including Bianca herself).

To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{36}{4} = 9\n   \\]\n   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.\nTherefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \\(\\boxed{9}\\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**\n   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.\n   \\[\n   40 - 20 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.\n\n2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**\n   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20}{4} = 5\n   \\]\n   So, the store used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the number of shelves the store used is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**\n   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.\n   \\[\n   35 - 19 = 16\n   \\]\n   So, Edward has 16 games left.\n\n2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**\n   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.\n   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:\n   \\[\n   16 \\div 8 = 2\n   \\]\n   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.\nTherefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.\n2. Determine the cost of these tickets.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\\[ 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\]\nSo, Haley spent \\(\\boxed{32}\\) dollars on tickets.\n\nQuestion:  A store had 48 coloring books in stock.
