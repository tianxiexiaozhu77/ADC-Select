How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe store initially had 40 coloring books. After putting 20 of them on sale, they were left with 40 - 20 = 20 coloring books. These remaining 20 books were then organized onto shelves with 4 books each. To find out how many shelves were used, we divide the total number of remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 20 / 4 = 5. Therefore, 5 shelves were used to store the remaining books.\nTherefore, the answer is (5).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nEdward initially had 35 games and sold 19 of them. To find out how many games are left, we subtract the number of games sold from the total number of games he originally had, which is 35 - 19 = 16 games. Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack these remaining games, with each box holding 8 games. To find this, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold, which is 16 / 8 = 2. Therefore, Edward needs to use 2 boxes to pack the remaining games.\nTherefore, the answer is (2).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

Next, determine the total cost by multiplying the number of tickets (8) by the cost per ticket (4 dollars), which results in 8 * 4 = 32 dollars. Therefore, Haley spent a total of 32 dollars on tickets.\nTherefore, the answer is (32).\n\nQuestion:  Roger had 25 books. If he sold 21 of them and used the money he earned to buy 30 new books, how many books would Roger have? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "First, let's find out how many books Roger has left after selling 21 of them. This is done by subtracting the number of books he sold from the total number of books he had initially: 25 - 21 = 4 books.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many books Roger bought with the money he earned from selling the 21 books. Since he used all the money to buy 30 new books, we can find out how many books he bought by dividing the amount of money he earned by the cost per book: 21 books * 4 dollars/book = 84 dollars. Then, we divide the total amount of money he spent on the new books by the cost per book: 84 dollars / 30 books/book = 2.8 dollars/book (since we can't have a fraction of a book). However, since the cost per book is given as 4 dollars, it means that Roger bought 2 books with the money he earned from selling the 21 books.\n\nFinally, we add the number of books he has left (4) to the number of books he bought (2) to find the total number of books Roger has: 4 + 2 = 6 books.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (6).", 'true_answer': [34.0]}

If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there are 46 books to be shelved. A librarian takes 10 books, leaving Oliver with 36 books to shelve. The capacity of each shelf is 4 books. To find out how many shelves Oliver needs, divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold: 36 books / 4 books per shelf = 9 shelves.

To find out how many games are left, we subtract the number of games sold from the total number of games he originally had, which is 35 - 19 = 16 games. Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack these remaining games, with each box holding 8 games.

Next, determine the total cost by multiplying the number of tickets (8) by the cost per ticket (4 dollars), which results in 8 * 4 = 32 dollars. Therefore, Haley spent a total of 32 dollars on tickets.\nTherefore, the answer is (32).\n\nQuestion:  Tom was putting his spare change into piles. He had 2 piles of quarters and 4 piles of dimes. If each pile had 5 coins in it, how many coins did he have total? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "First, let's find out how many coins Tom has in his quarters piles. Since there are 2 piles and each pile has 5 coins, he has 2 * 5 = 10 quarters.\n\nNext, let's find out how many coins Tom has in his dimes piles. Since there are 4 piles and each pile has 5 coins, he has 4 * 5 = 20 dimes.\n\nNow, we need to convert the number of quarters into dimes since both are 10-cent coins. To do this, we multiply the number of quarters by the number of dimes in a dollar (10), and then divide by the number of quarters in a dollar (4). This gives us the equivalent number of dimes: 10 * (100 / 4) = 250 / 4 = 62.5. Since we cannot have half a coin, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 63 dimes.\n\nNow, we add the number of dimes from the piles to the number of dimes from the conversion: 20 + 63 = 83 dimes.\n\nFinally, we add the number of quarters to the number of dimes to find the total number of coins: 10 + 83 = 93 coins.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (93).", 'true_answer': [30.0]}

These remaining 20 books were then organized onto shelves with 4 books each. To find out how many shelves were used, we divide the total number of remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 20 / 4 = 5. Therefore, 5 shelves were used to store the remaining books.\nTherefore, the answer is (5).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nEdward initially had 35 games and sold 19 of them. To find out how many games are left, we subtract the number of games sold from the total number of games he originally had, which is 35 - 19 = 16 games. Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack these remaining games, with each box holding 8 games. To find this, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold, which is 16 / 8 = 2. Therefore, Edward needs to use 2 boxes to pack the remaining games.\nTherefore, the answer is (2).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of tickets Haley purchased by adding the 3 tickets she bought for herself and her friends to the 5 extra tickets, which gives 3 + 5 = 8 tickets. Next, determine the total cost by multiplying the number of tickets (8) by the cost per ticket (4 dollars), which results in 8 * 4 = 32 dollars. Therefore, Haley spent a total of 32 dollars on tickets.\nTherefore, the answer is (32).\n\nQuestion:  Henry was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 9 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 29 trays from one table and 52 trays from another, how many trips will he make? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "First, let's find out how many trays Henry needs to pick up in total. He picks up 29 trays from the first table and 52 trays from the second table, so the total number of trays is 29 + 52 = 81 trays.\n\nSince Henry can only carry 9 trays at a time, we need to determine how many trips he will make by dividing the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry per trip: 81 trays / 9 trays per trip = 9 trips for the first table and some remaining trays.\n\nFor the remaining trays, we subtract the number of trays Henry can carry in one trip (9) from the total number of trays left (81 - 29 = 52), which gives us 52 - 9 = 43 trays. Now, we divide the remaining trays by the number of trays Henry can carry per trip (43 / 9) to find out how many trips he will make for the second table.\n\nSince the remainder when dividing 43 by 9 is 4, Henry will make 4 trips for the remaining trays and 9 trips for the first table, making a total of 9 + 4 = 13 trips.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (13).", 'true_answer': [9.0]}

She has 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies, so she has a total of 23 + 25 = 48 cookies.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many baggies Robin can make with 6 cookies in each bag. To do this, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per bag, which is 48 / 6 = 8. However, since Robin has both chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies, she cannot make baggies with only one type of cookie. So, we need to find the maximum number of baggies she can make with at least one type of cookie in each bag.\n\nSince there are more chocolate chip cookies than oatmeal cookies, let's start by using all the chocolate chip cookies to fill baggies. Robin can make 23 / 6 = 3.83 baggies with only chocolate chip cookies. Since she can't have a fraction of a baggie, she can make 3 baggies with only chocolate chip cookies.\n\nNow, let's see if there are enough oatmeal cookies to make additional baggies. Robin has 25 oatmeal cookies, and she already used 3 * 6 = 18 chocolate chip cookies. So, she has 25 - 18 = 7 oatmeal cookies left. She can make 7 / 6 = 1.16 baggies with only oatmeal cookies. Again, since she can't have a fraction of a baggie, she can make 1 baggie with only oatmeal cookies.\n\nIn total, Robin can make 3 (chocolate chip) + 1 (oatmeal) = 4 baggies.

Therefore, Oliver will need 9 shelves to fit all the books.\nTherefore, the answer is (9).\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe store initially had 40 coloring books. After putting 20 of them on sale, they were left with 40 - 20 = 20 coloring books. These remaining 20 books were then organized onto shelves with 4 books each. To find out how many shelves were used, we divide the total number of remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 20 / 4 = 5. Therefore, 5 shelves were used to store the remaining books.\nTherefore, the answer is (5).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nEdward initially had 35 games and sold 19 of them. To find out how many games are left, we subtract the number of games sold from the total number of games he originally had, which is 35 - 19 = 16 games. Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack these remaining games, with each box holding 8 games. To find this, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold, which is 16 / 8 = 2. Therefore, Edward needs to use 2 boxes to pack the remaining games.\nTherefore, the answer is (2).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of tickets Haley purchased by adding the 3 tickets she bought for herself and her friends to the 5 extra tickets, which gives 3 + 5 = 8 tickets. Next, determine the total cost by multiplying the number of tickets (8) by the cost per ticket (4 dollars), which results in 8 * 4 = 32 dollars. Therefore, Haley spent a total of 32 dollars on tickets.\nTherefore, the answer is (32).\n\nQuestion:  Nancy's old washing machine could only wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time. If she had to wash 19 shirts and 8 sweaters how many loads would she have to do? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "First, let's find out how many loads are needed for the shirts. Since the washing machine can wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time, we need to find out how many full loads of shirts can be done and then calculate the remaining shirts that will require a partial load.\n\nFor full loads, divide the number of shirts by the number of clothes the washing machine can wash at a time: 19 shirts / 9 clothes per load = 2 full loads.\n\nNow, let's find out how many shirts are left for a partial load. Subtract the number of full loads from the total number of shirts: 19 shirts - (2 * 9) = 19 - 18 = 1 shirt.\n\nNext, let's find out how many loads are needed for the sweaters. Since the washing machine can wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time, we can wash 1 full load of sweaters.\n\nNow, let's add the number of full loads for shirts and sweaters: 2 full loads (shirts) + 1 full load (sweaters) = 3 loads.\n\nHowever, we still have 1 shirt left that requires a partial load. Since the washing machine can wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time, we can wash 1 full load of the remaining clothes (1 shirt + 8 sweaters = 9 clothes).\n\nTherefore, Nancy will have to do 4 loads in total: 3 full loads (2 for shirts and 1 for the remaining clothes) and 1 partial load (for the remaining shirt).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (4).", 'true_answer': [3.0]}

If he already painted 2 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "First, let's find out how many rooms are left to be painted. Since the painter has already painted 2 rooms, there are 11 - 2 = 9 rooms remaining.\n\nNext, let's determine how many hours it takes to paint the remaining rooms. Since each room takes 7 hours to paint, we multiply the number of remaining rooms by the time per room: 9 * 7 = 63 hours.\n\nSince the painter has already spent some time painting the first 2 rooms, we need to subtract the time he's already spent from the total time needed to paint the remaining rooms. Let's assume that each room takes 1 hour to prepare and clean up, so the painter spends 2 hours on the first 2 rooms. The total time he's already spent is 2 hours.\n\nTo find out how much longer he will take to paint the rest, we subtract the time he's already spent from the total time needed to paint the remaining rooms: 63 hours - 2 hours = 61 hours.\n\nTherefore, the painter will take an additional 61 hours to paint the remaining rooms.\n\nThe answer is (61).", 'true_answer': [63.0]}

If 12 of them left and the rest of his tables had 3 people at each table, how many tables did he have? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "First, let's find out how many customers are still at the waiter's section. We do this by subtracting the number of customers who left (12) from the total number of customers (21), which gives us 21 - 12 = 9 customers.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many tables these remaining customers are distributed across, with each table having 3 people. To find this, we divide the number of remaining customers by the number of people per table, which is 9 / 3 = 3 tables.\n\nTherefore, the waiter had 3 tables with customers initially, and he lost 12 customers from those tables. Since the remaining customers are still distributed across the same tables, he still has 3 tables.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of tables he had, not the number of tables he still has. Since he initially had 3 tables, the answer is (3).", 'true_answer': [3.0]}

If Bianca scored 45 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "First, let's find out the total number of points scored by everyone else on the team. We know that Bianca scored 45 points and everyone else scored 6 points each. So, the total number of points scored by everyone else is the total points minus the points scored by Bianca, which is 75 - 45 = 30 points.\n\nSince everyone else scored 6 points each, we can divide the total number of points scored by everyone else by the number of points each person scored to find out how many people scored those points. This gives us 30 / 6 = 5 people.\n\nHowever, we need to account for Bianca as well, since she is also part of the team. So, the total number of players on the team is the number of people who scored points for everyone else (5) plus Bianca herself, which is 5 + 1 = 6 players.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (6).", 'true_answer': [5.0]}
