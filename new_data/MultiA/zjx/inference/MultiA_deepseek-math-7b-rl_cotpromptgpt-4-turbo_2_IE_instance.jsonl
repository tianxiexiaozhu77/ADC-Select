If she solved 70 of these problems at school, how many problems did she need to complete later at home?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmily had a total of 65 algebra equations and 15 geometry problems, making it 80 problems altogether. She solved 70 of these problems at school. So, the number of problems left for her to complete at home would be the total problems minus the problems she already solved: 80 - 70 = 10. However, reevaluating the initial problem statement, Emily actually had a total of 80 problems and she solved 70 of them at school, so she would have 80 - 70 = 10 problems to finish at home. But, if we consider that she solved 70 out of these 80, it implies that if there's no indication of any issue or special context (such as problems having to be revised or redone), then it can be deduced that she completed all necessary work within the 70 problems she addressed at school, assuming each problem was solved correctly and to completion.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: Rachel had 50 physics problems and 10 chemistry problems as her schoolwork.

To find out the time required to prepare the remaining meals, first find the number of meals left by subtracting the number of meals already made from the total meals needed. The calculation is 200 - 150 = 50 meals left to prepare. Since each meal takes 0.5 hours, the total time needed for 50 meals is 50 meals * 0.5 hours/meal = 25 hours. Therefore, it will take 25 more hours to prepare the remaining meals.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: A chef must prepare 80 meals for a banquet. He has already prepared 30 meals. If it takes 10 minutes to prepare each meal, how long will it take him to prepare the remaining meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the number of remaining meals by subtracting the number of meals already prepared from the total number of meals. The total number of meals is 80 and the chef has already prepared 30 meals. So, the remaining meals to prepare are 80 - 30 = 50. Next, if each meal takes 10 minutes to prepare, and the chef has 50 more meals to prepare, the total time required will be 50 meals * 10 minutes/meal = 500 minutes.\nTherefore, the answer is (500)\n\nQuestion:  A chef needs to cook 15 potatoes.

Total points scored by the team is 30, and Sophie scored 18 points. Subtracting Sophie's points from the total gives 30 - 18 = 12 points that were scored by other team members. We know each of these remaining team members scored 3 points. To find out how many such team members there were, divide the remaining 12 points by 3 points per team member, which results in 12 / 3 = 4. Counting Sophie and her teammates together, the total number of players on the team is 4 + 1 = 5.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQuestion:  Emily's team won their dodgeball game and scored 39 points total.

We do this by subtracting Emily's points from the total points. So, 39 - 23 = 16 points were scored by the other players.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many other players there were. Since each of these players scored 2 points, we divide the total points scored by the other players by 2. So, 16 / 2 = 8. This means there were 8 other players.\n\nFinally, we add Emily to the other players to find the total number of players on the team. So, 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo, there were 9 players on Emily's team. The answer is (9).", 'true_answer': [8.0]}

For lunch they handed out 19 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 8 apples, how many pies could they make? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': ' First, we need to find out how many apples are left after the cafeteria handed out 19 apples to students. We do this by subtracting 19 from the total number of apples, which is 75. So, 75 - 19 = 56 apples are left.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many pies they can make with the remaining 56 apples. Since each pie requires 8 apples, we divide the number of remaining apples by the number of apples per pie. So, 56 ÷ 8 = 7 pies.\n\nTherefore, the cafeteria can make 7 pies with the remaining apples.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{7}$.', 'true_answer': [7.0]}

{'question': ' Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook. She put 37 pics into one album and put the rest into 2 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? ', 'idx': 599, 'prompt': "Q: Tom shot 130 photos with his DSLR and 70 with his smartphone during his trip. If he created 20 different photo albums with the same number of photos in each album, how many photos were in each album?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we find the total number of photos Tom shot: 130 photos with his DSLR plus 70 photos with his smartphone, which sum up to 200 photos in total. Then, since he created 20 different photo albums and each album has the same number of photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of albums. Therefore, 200 total photos divided by 20 albums equals 10 photos per album.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Sarah was placing her photographs in an album with 6 photos on each page. After taking 5 new photos and having 53 old photos, how many album pages did she use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of photos Sarah has by adding her old photos and new photos. She has 53 old photos and she took 5 new ones, so 53 + 5 = 58 photos in total. Each album page can hold 6 photos, so to find the number of pages she used, divide the total number of photos by the number of photos each page can hold. Calculate 58 / 6 = 9.67. Since she can't use a fraction of a page, round up to the next whole number, which is 10. Therefore, Sarah used 10 full pages to hold all her photos.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQuestion:  Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook.
