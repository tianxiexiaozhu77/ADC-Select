If she finished 50 of these questions during her lunch break, how many questions did she have to complete after school?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nAnna had a total of 40 literature review questions and 20 thesis statement questions, making 40 + 20 = 60 questions in total. During her lunch break, she completed 50 questions. To find out how many she had left to complete after school, we subtract the number of questions she completed from the total number of questions: 60 - 50 = 10 questions. However, it was stated that she finished 50 of 'these questions' implying those were all the questions she had. Thus, there should be no leftover questions, which seems to be a discrepancy since adding the number of individual questions shows there should be 10 remaining. Yet, based on the statement, since it implies all questions were finished, we consider 0.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: Maria had 48 English assignments and 32 art projects to do. If she completed 70 of them at school, how many assignments did she have left for home?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of assignments and projects Maria had, which is the sum of English assignments and art projects. Thus, 48 (English assignments) + 32 (art projects) = 80. Next, we determine how many assignments are left for home by subtracting the number of assignments completed at school from the total assignments. Therefore, 80 (total assignments and projects) - 70 (completed at school) = 10. However, since the problem states that she completed 70 assignments at school and she had only 80 in total, it means she doesn't have any left for home if all were completed.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: Anna was expanding her art supplies.

Next, consider that each bouquet purchased represents a combination of roses and tulips. If 125 bouquets were sold and assuming a worst-case scenario each bouquet used at least 1 flower, 125 flowers in total would be used. If each bouquet used at least 3 flowers, 375 flowers would be used, which exceeds the total prepared, leading to zero extra flowers with a practical bouquet composition. It's safe to assume that each bouquet uses at least 2 to 3 flowers and thus all 350 flowers would adequately be accounted for in 125 bouquets.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: The florist arranged 40 roses and 60 tulips for a wedding.

Thus, 48 (English assignments) + 32 (art projects) = 80. Next, we determine how many assignments are left for home by subtracting the number of assignments completed at school from the total assignments. Therefore, 80 (total assignments and projects) - 70 (completed at school) = 10. However, since the problem states that she completed 70 assignments at school and she had only 80 in total, it means she doesn't have any left for home if all were completed.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: A school ordered 300 pencils and 200 notebooks for the new semester.

If only 4 people showed interest, how many extra books did the library end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of books ordered by the library. This is done by adding the number of new books and old books ordered: 57 (new books) + 45 (old books) = 102 books in total. Next, divide this number by the number of people who showed interest to determine how many books each person would need if they were to distribute evenly: 102 books / 4 people = 25.5 books per person. Since it's unlikely the books were cut in half and given out, we assume each person gets 25 books, meaning 4 * 25 = 100 books are distributed. Therefore, the library ends up with 102 total ordered - 100 distributed = 2 extra books.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQuestion:  A book store had 41 books in the bargin bin.

If she only used 15 of the flowers, how many extra flowers did Nancy pick?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we count the total number of flowers Nancy picked, which is 20 daisies plus 6 sunflowers, summing up to 26 flowers. Next, we know that she used 15 of these flowers. To find the extra flowers, subtract the number used (15) from the total number of flowers picked (26). This calculation is 26 - 15, which equals 11. Therefore, Nancy picked 11 extra flowers.\nTherefore, the answer is (11)\n\nQ: A florist had 72 flowers in a vase. If they threw out 12 wilted flowers and put 30 fresh ones in the vase, how many flowers would be in the vase?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nOriginally, the florist had 72 flowers. After removing 12 wilted flowers, 72 - 12 = 60 flowers remained.

If they sold 40 flowers, but then received 11 new flowers, how many flowers would be in the shop?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the remaining flowers after sales by subtracting the number of flowers sold from the initial amount. Initially, there were 87 flowers and 40 were sold, so 87 - 40 = 47 flowers remained. Then, the florist received 11 new flowers, so add these to the remaining flowers to find the total. Therefore, 47 (remaining flowers) + 11 (new flowers) = 58 flowers in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (58)\n\nQ: A flower shop prepared 200 roses and 150 tulips for Valentine's Day, but only 125 bouquets were purchased. How many extra flowers did the shop end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, sum the total flowers prepared by the shop: 200 roses + 150 tulips = 350 flowers. Next, consider that each bouquet purchased represents a combination of roses and tulips. If 125 bouquets were sold and assuming a worst-case scenario each bouquet used at least 1 flower, 125 flowers in total would be used. If each bouquet used at least 3 flowers, 375 flowers would be used, which exceeds the total prepared, leading to zero extra flowers with a practical bouquet composition. It's safe to assume that each bouquet uses at least 2 to 3 flowers and thus all 350 flowers would adequately be accounted for in 125 bouquets.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: A flower shop had 9 bouquets in their cooler. If they sold 6 bouquets, but then created 13 more, how many bouquets would be in the cooler?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe flower shop started with 9 bouquets.

Next, consider that each bouquet purchased represents a combination of roses and tulips. If 125 bouquets were sold and assuming a worst-case scenario each bouquet used at least 1 flower, 125 flowers in total would be used. If each bouquet used at least 3 flowers, 375 flowers would be used, which exceeds the total prepared, leading to zero extra flowers with a practical bouquet composition. It's safe to assume that each bouquet uses at least 2 to 3 flowers and thus all 350 flowers would adequately be accounted for in 125 bouquets.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: A nursery purchased 90 roses and 70 tulips for a special event.

If 6 gardeners came shopping, how many extra plants were not sold?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe problem does not provide information on how many plants each gardener bought or if there were any plants actually sold. Without details on the sale transactions or the distribution of the plants to the gardeners, it is impossible to determine how many plants, if any, were left unsold. Therefore, we assume that there were no extra plants left unsold as the initial information is insufficient to conclude otherwise.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: Nancy picked 20 daisies and 6 sunflowers for a floral display. If she only used 15 of the flowers, how many extra flowers did Nancy pick?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we count the total number of flowers Nancy picked, which is 20 daisies plus 6 sunflowers, summing up to 26 flowers. Next, we know that she used 15 of these flowers. To find the extra flowers, subtract the number used (15) from the total number of flowers picked (26). This calculation is 26 - 15, which equals 11.

But, if only 140 guests wanted flowers, how many extra did the nursery end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of flowers purchased by the nursery. The nursery bought 90 roses and 70 tulips, which sums up to 90 + 70 = 160 flowers. Next, we determine how many flowers were needed for the 140 guests; each guest wanted one flower, so 140 flowers were needed. Lastly, we calculate the difference between the total number of flowers bought and the number needed. This is 160 - 140 = 20. Hence, the nursery ended up with 20 extra flowers.\nTherefore, the answer is (20)\n\nQ: Emma was planting flowers in her garden and initially planted 20 flowers. She noticed that 5 flowers withered.

How many extra flowers did the shop end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, sum the total flowers prepared by the shop: 200 roses + 150 tulips = 350 flowers. Next, consider that each bouquet purchased represents a combination of roses and tulips. If 125 bouquets were sold and assuming a worst-case scenario each bouquet used at least 1 flower, 125 flowers in total would be used. If each bouquet used at least 3 flowers, 375 flowers would be used, which exceeds the total prepared, leading to zero extra flowers with a practical bouquet composition. It's safe to assume that each bouquet uses at least 2 to 3 flowers and thus all 350 flowers would adequately be accounted for in 125 bouquets.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: A florist had 25 roses.

{'question': ' A florist had 5 roses. If she sold 3 of them and then later picked 34 more, how many roses would she have? ', 'idx': 196, 'prompt': "Q: The florist arranged 40 roses and 60 tulips for a wedding. However, if only 70 flowers were used in the decoration, how many extra flowers did the florist have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of flowers the florist arranged, which is 40 roses + 60 tulips = 100 flowers.\nNext, subtract the number of flowers used in the decoration from the total number of flowers prepared.

If they sold 40 flowers, but then received 11 new flowers, how many flowers would be in the shop?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the remaining flowers after sales by subtracting the number of flowers sold from the initial amount. Initially, there were 87 flowers and 40 were sold, so 87 - 40 = 47 flowers remained. Then, the florist received 11 new flowers, so add these to the remaining flowers to find the total. Therefore, 47 (remaining flowers) + 11 (new flowers) = 58 flowers in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (58)\n\nQ: A flower shop prepared 200 roses and 150 tulips for Valentine's Day, but only 125 bouquets were purchased. How many extra flowers did the shop end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, sum the total flowers prepared by the shop: 200 roses + 150 tulips = 350 flowers. Next, consider that each bouquet purchased represents a combination of roses and tulips. If 125 bouquets were sold and assuming a worst-case scenario each bouquet used at least 1 flower, 125 flowers in total would be used. If each bouquet used at least 3 flowers, 375 flowers would be used, which exceeds the total prepared, leading to zero extra flowers with a practical bouquet composition. It's safe to assume that each bouquet uses at least 2 to 3 flowers and thus all 350 flowers would adequately be accounted for in 125 bouquets.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: A florist at 'Bloom & Grow' arranged bouquets for 40 customers.

He had 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes. If each pile had 3 coins in it, how many coins did he have total? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': " Luke had 5 piles of quarters, and each pile had 3 coins, so he had 5 * 3 = 15 quarters.\nHe also had 5 piles of dimes, and each pile had 3 coins, so he had 5 * 3 = 15 dimes.\n\nA quarter is worth 25 cents, so 15 quarters are worth 15 * 25 = 375 cents.\nA dime is worth 10 cents, so 15 dimes are worth 15 * 10 = 150 cents.\n\nTo find the total number of cents Luke had, we add the number of cents from the quarters and the dimes: 375 + 150 = 525 cents.\n\nSince 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we can convert the total number of cents to dollars by dividing by 100: 525 / 100 = 5.25 dollars.\n\nHowever, the number of coins cannot be a fraction, so we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps.\n\nWe know that each pile had 3 coins, and Luke had 5 piles of each type of coin. So the total number of coins should be 5 piles * 3 coins/pile * 2 types = 30 coins.\n\nLet's check if this is correct. If each coin is worth either 25 cents or 10 cents, then the total value of the coins should be 30 coins * (25 cents or 10 cents) = 750 cents or 300 cents, respectively.\n\nHowever, we found that the total value of the coins was 525 cents, which is not possible since it should be either 750 cents or 300 cents.\n\nLet's reevaluate our calculations. We found that Luke had 15 quarters and 15 dimes, which is a total of 30 coins. This is correct.\n\nTherefore, Luke had 30 coins in total.\nThe answer is: 30", 'true_answer': [30.0]}

He had 2 piles of quarters and 4 piles of dimes. If each pile had 5 coins in it, how many coins did he have total? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': " Tom had 2 piles of quarters, and each pile had 5 coins, so he had 2 * 5 = 10 quarters.\nHe also had 4 piles of dimes, and each pile had 5 coins, so he had 4 * 5 = 20 dimes.\n\nA quarter is worth 25 cents, so 10 quarters are worth 10 * 25 = 250 cents.\nA dime is worth 10 cents, so 20 dimes are worth 20 * 10 = 200 cents.\n\nTo find the total number of cents, we add the number of cents from the quarters and the dimes, so 250 + 200 = 450 cents.\n\nSince 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we can convert the total number of cents to dollars by dividing by 100, so 450 / 100 = 4.5 dollars.\n\nHowever, the number of coins should be a whole number, not a decimal. There must be a mistake in our calculation. Let's retrace our steps.\n\nWe know that each pile had 5 coins, and Tom had 2 piles of quarters and 4 piles of dimes. So the total number of coins should be (2 * 5) + (4 * 5) = 10 + 20 = 30 coins.\n\nLet's check our work. If each coin is worth either 25 cents (for a quarter) or 10 cents (for a dime), then the total value of the coins should be (10 * 25) + (20 * 10) = 250 + 200 = 450 cents, or 4.5 dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of tickets by the price per ticket: 9 tickets * 12 dollars per ticket = 108 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (108)\n\nQ: At Lucy's Grill, a group of 2 adults and 3 children ate. Each meal was costed at 7 dollars. How much did they spend on their meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of meals by adding the number of adults and children: 2 adults + 3 children = 5 meals. Next, since each meal costs 7 dollars, multiply the total number of meals by the price per meal: 5 meals * 7 dollars/meal = 35 dollars. Therefore, the total amount spent on meals is 35 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (35)\n\nQ: At a pizzeria, each adult pizza slice costs $2 and children get soda free. If a gathering of 18 people attended and 11 were children, what would be the total cost for the gathering?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the total cost for the gathering, establish the cost for adult pizza slices since soda for children is free. We know 18 people attended and 11 were children, thus 18 - 11 = 7 adults attended. Each adult slice costs $2. Since only the adult pizza slices have a cost, multiply the number of adults by the price per slice: 7 adults * $2 per slice = $14. The children's soda is free and does not add to the cost, so the total cost for the gathering is the cost of the adult pizza slices only.\nTherefore, the answer is (14)\n\nQ: At the ice cream truck, there were 10 people waiting for ice cream. If 3 of them left because it was taking too long and 7 more kids ran over, how many people would be in line?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 10 people waiting at the ice cream truck. If 3 people left the queue due to long waiting times, that leaves 10 - 3 = 7 people. Subsequently, 7 more kids joined the line. The number of people would increase by 7, meaning 7 + 7 = 14 people.\nTherefore, the answer is (14)\n\nQ: In a deli, each adult sandwich costs $7 and cookies are free for kids. If a team of 14 people went in and 8 were children, how much would it cost for the team to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, determine the number of adults in the team by subtracting the number of children from the total number of team members. There are 14 team members in total and 8 children, so 14 - 8 = 6 adults. Each adult sandwich costs $7, hence the total cost for the adult sandwiches would be 6 adults * $7/sandwich = $42. Cookies are free for kids, so there is no cost associated with feeding the children. Therefore, the total cost for the team is solely from the adult sandwiches.\nTherefore, the answer is (42)\n\nQ: At a buffet, each adult entry fee is $10 and kids under 5 eat free. If a group of 13 people visited and 7 were under the age of 5, what would be the total cost for the group?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are 13 people in total in the group, out of which 7 are under the age of 5 and hence they eat for free. This means there are 13 - 7 = 6 people who are paying the adult entry fee of $10 each. Thus, the total cost for the group would be 6 adults * $10/adult = $60.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQ: In a fast food joint, each burger costs $4 and fries come free. If a party of 15 people entered and 9 were kids who ate fries, how much would it cost for the party?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, identify the number of people who consumed burgers. Since 9 kids ate only fries and there were 15 people in total, the number of people who ate burgers is 15 - 9 = 6. Each burger costs $4, therefore the total cost for burgers is 6 * $4 = $24. Since fries are free, there are no additional costs for the fries. Hence, the total cost for the party is solely from the burgers which is $24.\nTherefore, the answer is (24)\n\nQ: In a cafeteria, each adult plate costs $6 and salad is free for kids. If a group of 20 people came in and 12 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, determine the number of adults and children in the group from the total of 20 people, with 12 being kids, it follows that there are 8 adults. Each adult plate costs $6, hence, the total cost for all adult plates is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per plate, which is 8 * $6 = $48. Since salads are free for kids, there is no additional cost for the 12 kids. Thus, the total cost for the group to eat is simply the cost of the adult plates.\nTherefore, the answer is (48)\n\nQuestion:  At a restaurant each adult meal costs $3 and kids eat free. If a group of 12 people came in and 7 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': ' First, we need to find out how many adults are in the group.

First, for the fiction section with 21 books, since John can carry 7 books at a time: 21 books divided by 7 books per trip equals 3 trips. Next, for the non-fiction section with 29 books, dividing this by 7 gives about 4.14, which means he actually needs to make 5 trips (because he can't make a fraction of a trip and he needs an additional trip for the remaining books). Therefore, total trips = trips for fiction + trips for non-fiction = 3 + 5 = 8.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: John was updating his movie collection.

If a gathering of 18 people attended and 11 were children, what would be the total cost for the gathering?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the total cost for the gathering, establish the cost for adult pizza slices since soda for children is free. We know 18 people attended and 11 were children, thus 18 - 11 = 7 adults attended. Each adult slice costs $2. Since only the adult pizza slices have a cost, multiply the number of adults by the price per slice: 7 adults * $2 per slice = $14.

If a party of 15 comes in and 10 are kids, what would be the total cost for the party to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total cost of the meals for the party, we need to determine the number of adults and children. The problem states that there are 15 people in total and 10 of them are kids. The number of adults is 15 - 10 = 5. Each adult burger costs $8, so the cost for the adult burgers is 5 adults x $8/adult = $40. Since kid's meals are free, there is no cost associated with the 10 kids' meals. Adding the costs gives us a total cost of $40 for the adults' meals only, as the kids' meals are free.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: In a deli, each adult sandwich costs $7 and cookies are free for kids. If a team of 14 people went in and 8 were children, how much would it cost for the team to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, determine the number of adults in the team by subtracting the number of children from the total number of team members. There are 14 team members in total and 8 children, so 14 - 8 = 6 adults. Each adult sandwich costs $7, hence the total cost for the adult sandwiches would be 6 adults * $7/sandwich = $42.

{'question': ' At a restaurant each adult meal costs $5 and kids eat free. If a group of 15 people came in and 8 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat? ', 'idx': 462, 'prompt': "Q: At the coffee shop, there were 14 people in line for coffee. If 5 of them left to try a new cafe and 4 more customers arrived, how many people would be in line?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 14 people in line. After 5 people left, there were 14 - 5 = 9 people left in line. Then, 4 more customers arrived, making the total number of people in line 9 + 4 = 13.\nTherefore, the answer is (13)\n\nQ: At a pizzeria, each adult pizza slice costs $2 and children get soda free. If a gathering of 18 people attended and 11 were children, what would be the total cost for the gathering?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the total cost for the gathering, establish the cost for adult pizza slices since soda for children is free. We know 18 people attended and 11 were children, thus 18 - 11 = 7 adults attended. Each adult slice costs $2. Since only the adult pizza slices have a cost, multiply the number of adults by the price per slice: 7 adults * $2 per slice = $14. The children's soda is free and does not add to the cost, so the total cost for the gathering is the cost of the adult pizza slices only.\nTherefore, the answer is (14)\n\nQ: In a deli, each adult sandwich costs $7 and cookies are free for kids. If a team of 14 people went in and 8 were children, how much would it cost for the team to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, determine the number of adults in the team by subtracting the number of children from the total number of team members. There are 14 team members in total and 8 children, so 14 - 8 = 6 adults. Each adult sandwich costs $7, hence the total cost for the adult sandwiches would be 6 adults * $7/sandwich = $42. Cookies are free for kids, so there is no cost associated with feeding the children. Therefore, the total cost for the team is solely from the adult sandwiches.\nTherefore, the answer is (42)\n\nQ: At a buffet, each adult entry fee is $10 and kids under 5 eat free. If a group of 13 people visited and 7 were under the age of 5, what would be the total cost for the group?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are 13 people in total in the group, out of which 7 are under the age of 5 and hence they eat for free. This means there are 13 - 7 = 6 people who are paying the adult entry fee of $10 each. Thus, the total cost for the group would be 6 adults * $10/adult = $60.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQ: In a cafeteria, each adult plate costs $6 and salad is free for kids. If a group of 20 people came in and 12 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, determine the number of adults and children in the group from the total of 20 people, with 12 being kids, it follows that there are 8 adults. Each adult plate costs $6, hence, the total cost for all adult plates is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per plate, which is 8 * $6 = $48. Since salads are free for kids, there is no additional cost for the 12 kids. Thus, the total cost for the group to eat is simply the cost of the adult plates.\nTherefore, the answer is (48)\n\nQ: At a diner each adult burger costs $8 while a kid's meal is free. If a party of 15 comes in and 10 are kids, what would be the total cost for the party to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total cost of the meals for the party, we need to determine the number of adults and children. The problem states that there are 15 people in total and 10 of them are kids. The number of adults is 15 - 10 = 5. Each adult burger costs $8, so the cost for the adult burgers is 5 adults x $8/adult = $40. Since kid's meals are free, there is no cost associated with the 10 kids' meals. Adding the costs gives us a total cost of $40 for the adults' meals only, as the kids' meals are free.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: In a cafe each adult coffee costs $5 and children's hot chocolate is free. If a group of 10 people visited and 7 were children, how much would it cost for the group to have their drinks?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, evaluate the number of adults in the group, which is 10 total people minus 7 children, giving 3 adults. Each adult coffee is $5. So, the total cost for the adult coffees is 3 adults times $5 each, which equals $15. Since children's hot chocolate is free, there is no additional cost for the 7 children's drinks. Adding the costs together, the total cost for the group’s drinks is just for the adult coffees which is $15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: In a fast food joint, each burger costs $4 and fries come free. If a party of 15 people entered and 9 were kids who ate fries, how much would it cost for the party?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, identify the number of people who consumed burgers. Since 9 kids ate only fries and there were 15 people in total, the number of people who ate burgers is 15 - 9 = 6. Each burger costs $4, therefore the total cost for burgers is 6 * $4 = $24. Since fries are free, there are no additional costs for the fries. Hence, the total cost for the party is solely from the burgers which is $24.\nTherefore, the answer is (24)\n\nQuestion:  At a restaurant each adult meal costs $5 and kids eat free.

There were 40 cups in the store room and 30 cups in the kitchen, adding up to 70 cups in total. Next, since Maria can only handle 10 cups at once, we need to divide the total number of cups by the number she can carry per trip. So, 70 cups divided by 10 cups per trip equals 7 trips.

During the party, 10 cookies were eaten, so she was left with 32 - 10 = 22 cookies. If she made another 18 cookies the next day, she would have 22 + 18 = 40 cookies in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: Rachel was baking cookies for a party. On the first day, she baked 6 batches of cookies and on the second day, she baked 4 more batches.

{'question': ' At a restaurant each adult meal costs $2 and kids eat free. If a group of 15 people came in and 9 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat? ', 'idx': 478, 'prompt': "Q: At a pizzeria, each adult pizza slice costs $2 and children get soda free. If a gathering of 18 people attended and 11 were children, what would be the total cost for the gathering?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the total cost for the gathering, establish the cost for adult pizza slices since soda for children is free. We know 18 people attended and 11 were children, thus 18 - 11 = 7 adults attended. Each adult slice costs $2. Since only the adult pizza slices have a cost, multiply the number of adults by the price per slice: 7 adults * $2 per slice = $14. The children's soda is free and does not add to the cost, so the total cost for the gathering is the cost of the adult pizza slices only.\nTherefore, the answer is (14)\n\nQ: In a deli, each adult sandwich costs $7 and cookies are free for kids. If a team of 14 people went in and 8 were children, how much would it cost for the team to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, determine the number of adults in the team by subtracting the number of children from the total number of team members. There are 14 team members in total and 8 children, so 14 - 8 = 6 adults. Each adult sandwich costs $7, hence the total cost for the adult sandwiches would be 6 adults * $7/sandwich = $42. Cookies are free for kids, so there is no cost associated with feeding the children. Therefore, the total cost for the team is solely from the adult sandwiches.\nTherefore, the answer is (42)\n\nQ: At a cafe, each adult coffee costs $3 and children's hot chocolate is free. If a group of 12 people visited and 7 of them were children, how much would it cost for the group to drink?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much it would cost for the group to drink, we need to calculate the total cost of drinks for the adults only, since children's hot chocolate is free. Given that each adult coffee costs $3, we first determine how many adults are in the group. From a total of 12 people, 7 of them are children, so there are 12 - 7 = 5 adults. The total cost for the adults' coffee is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per coffee: 5 adults * $3 per coffee = $15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: At a buffet, each adult entry fee is $10 and kids under 5 eat free. If a group of 13 people visited and 7 were under the age of 5, what would be the total cost for the group?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are 13 people in total in the group, out of which 7 are under the age of 5 and hence they eat for free. This means there are 13 - 7 = 6 people who are paying the adult entry fee of $10 each. Thus, the total cost for the group would be 6 adults * $10/adult = $60.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQ: At a diner each adult burger costs $8 while a kid's meal is free. If a party of 15 comes in and 10 are kids, what would be the total cost for the party to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total cost of the meals for the party, we need to determine the number of adults and children. The problem states that there are 15 people in total and 10 of them are kids. The number of adults is 15 - 10 = 5. Each adult burger costs $8, so the cost for the adult burgers is 5 adults x $8/adult = $40. Since kid's meals are free, there is no cost associated with the 10 kids' meals. Adding the costs gives us a total cost of $40 for the adults' meals only, as the kids' meals are free.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: In a cafeteria, each adult plate costs $6 and salad is free for kids. If a group of 20 people came in and 12 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, determine the number of adults and children in the group from the total of 20 people, with 12 being kids, it follows that there are 8 adults. Each adult plate costs $6, hence, the total cost for all adult plates is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per plate, which is 8 * $6 = $48. Since salads are free for kids, there is no additional cost for the 12 kids. Thus, the total cost for the group to eat is simply the cost of the adult plates.\nTherefore, the answer is (48)\n\nQ: In a cafe each adult coffee costs $5 and children's hot chocolate is free. If a group of 10 people visited and 7 were children, how much would it cost for the group to have their drinks?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, evaluate the number of adults in the group, which is 10 total people minus 7 children, giving 3 adults. Each adult coffee is $5. So, the total cost for the adult coffees is 3 adults times $5 each, which equals $15. Since children's hot chocolate is free, there is no additional cost for the 7 children's drinks. Adding the costs together, the total cost for the group’s drinks is just for the adult coffees which is $15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: In a fast food joint, each burger costs $4 and fries come free. If a party of 15 people entered and 9 were kids who ate fries, how much would it cost for the party?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, identify the number of people who consumed burgers. Since 9 kids ate only fries and there were 15 people in total, the number of people who ate burgers is 15 - 9 = 6. Each burger costs $4, therefore the total cost for burgers is 6 * $4 = $24. Since fries are free, there are no additional costs for the fries. Hence, the total cost for the party is solely from the burgers which is $24.\nTherefore, the answer is (24)\n\nQuestion:  At a restaurant each adult meal costs $2 and kids eat free.

The owner started with 18 puzzles and had 11 left at the end of the day, so the number of puzzles sold is 18 - 11 = 7 puzzles. Next, since each puzzle was sold for 6 dollars, we multiply the number of puzzles sold by the price per puzzle to find the total earnings. That is 7 puzzles * 6 dollars/puzzle = 42 dollars. Therefore, the owner earned a total of 42 dollars by selling the puzzles.\nTherefore, the answer is (42)\n\nQ: Each book in a pile costs $5.

{'question': ' At a restaurant each adult meal costs $8 and kids eat free. If a group of 11 people came in and 2 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat? ', 'idx': 483, 'prompt': "Q: At a pizzeria, each adult pizza slice costs $2 and children get soda free. If a gathering of 18 people attended and 11 were children, what would be the total cost for the gathering?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the total cost for the gathering, establish the cost for adult pizza slices since soda for children is free. We know 18 people attended and 11 were children, thus 18 - 11 = 7 adults attended. Each adult slice costs $2. Since only the adult pizza slices have a cost, multiply the number of adults by the price per slice: 7 adults * $2 per slice = $14. The children's soda is free and does not add to the cost, so the total cost for the gathering is the cost of the adult pizza slices only.\nTherefore, the answer is (14)\n\nQ: In a deli, each adult sandwich costs $7 and cookies are free for kids. If a team of 14 people went in and 8 were children, how much would it cost for the team to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, determine the number of adults in the team by subtracting the number of children from the total number of team members. There are 14 team members in total and 8 children, so 14 - 8 = 6 adults. Each adult sandwich costs $7, hence the total cost for the adult sandwiches would be 6 adults * $7/sandwich = $42. Cookies are free for kids, so there is no cost associated with feeding the children. Therefore, the total cost for the team is solely from the adult sandwiches.\nTherefore, the answer is (42)\n\nQ: At a buffet, each adult entry fee is $10 and kids under 5 eat free. If a group of 13 people visited and 7 were under the age of 5, what would be the total cost for the group?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are 13 people in total in the group, out of which 7 are under the age of 5 and hence they eat for free. This means there are 13 - 7 = 6 people who are paying the adult entry fee of $10 each. Thus, the total cost for the group would be 6 adults * $10/adult = $60.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQ: At a diner each adult burger costs $8 while a kid's meal is free. If a party of 15 comes in and 10 are kids, what would be the total cost for the party to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total cost of the meals for the party, we need to determine the number of adults and children. The problem states that there are 15 people in total and 10 of them are kids. The number of adults is 15 - 10 = 5. Each adult burger costs $8, so the cost for the adult burgers is 5 adults x $8/adult = $40. Since kid's meals are free, there is no cost associated with the 10 kids' meals. Adding the costs gives us a total cost of $40 for the adults' meals only, as the kids' meals are free.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: At a cafe, each adult coffee costs $3 and children's hot chocolate is free. If a group of 12 people visited and 7 of them were children, how much would it cost for the group to drink?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much it would cost for the group to drink, we need to calculate the total cost of drinks for the adults only, since children's hot chocolate is free. Given that each adult coffee costs $3, we first determine how many adults are in the group. From a total of 12 people, 7 of them are children, so there are 12 - 7 = 5 adults. The total cost for the adults' coffee is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per coffee: 5 adults * $3 per coffee = $15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: In a fast food joint, each burger costs $4 and fries come free. If a party of 15 people entered and 9 were kids who ate fries, how much would it cost for the party?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, identify the number of people who consumed burgers. Since 9 kids ate only fries and there were 15 people in total, the number of people who ate burgers is 15 - 9 = 6. Each burger costs $4, therefore the total cost for burgers is 6 * $4 = $24. Since fries are free, there are no additional costs for the fries. Hence, the total cost for the party is solely from the burgers which is $24.\nTherefore, the answer is (24)\n\nQ: In a cafeteria, each adult plate costs $6 and salad is free for kids. If a group of 20 people came in and 12 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, determine the number of adults and children in the group from the total of 20 people, with 12 being kids, it follows that there are 8 adults. Each adult plate costs $6, hence, the total cost for all adult plates is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per plate, which is 8 * $6 = $48. Since salads are free for kids, there is no additional cost for the 12 kids. Thus, the total cost for the group to eat is simply the cost of the adult plates.\nTherefore, the answer is (48)\n\nQ: In a cafe each adult coffee costs $5 and children's hot chocolate is free.

Each adult coffee is $5. So, the total cost for the adult coffees is 3 adults times $5 each, which equals $15. Since children's hot chocolate is free, there is no additional cost for the 7 children's drinks. Adding the costs together, the total cost for the group’s drinks is just for the adult coffees which is $15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQuestion:  At a restaurant each adult meal costs $8 and kids eat free.

', 'idx': 495, 'prompt': "Q: At a pizzeria, each adult pizza slice costs $2 and children get soda free. If a gathering of 18 people attended and 11 were children, what would be the total cost for the gathering?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the total cost for the gathering, establish the cost for adult pizza slices since soda for children is free. We know 18 people attended and 11 were children, thus 18 - 11 = 7 adults attended. Each adult slice costs $2. Since only the adult pizza slices have a cost, multiply the number of adults by the price per slice: 7 adults * $2 per slice = $14. The children's soda is free and does not add to the cost, so the total cost for the gathering is the cost of the adult pizza slices only.\nTherefore, the answer is (14)\n\nQ: At a diner each adult burger costs $8 while a kid's meal is free. If a party of 15 comes in and 10 are kids, what would be the total cost for the party to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total cost of the meals for the party, we need to determine the number of adults and children. The problem states that there are 15 people in total and 10 of them are kids. The number of adults is 15 - 10 = 5. Each adult burger costs $8, so the cost for the adult burgers is 5 adults x $8/adult = $40. Since kid's meals are free, there is no cost associated with the 10 kids' meals. Adding the costs gives us a total cost of $40 for the adults' meals only, as the kids' meals are free.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: In a deli, each adult sandwich costs $7 and cookies are free for kids. If a team of 14 people went in and 8 were children, how much would it cost for the team to eat?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, determine the number of adults in the team by subtracting the number of children from the total number of team members. There are 14 team members in total and 8 children, so 14 - 8 = 6 adults. Each adult sandwich costs $7, hence the total cost for the adult sandwiches would be 6 adults * $7/sandwich = $42. Cookies are free for kids, so there is no cost associated with feeding the children. Therefore, the total cost for the team is solely from the adult sandwiches.\nTherefore, the answer is (42)\n\nQ: At a buffet, each adult entry fee is $10 and kids under 5 eat free.

Thus, the total cost for the group would be 6 adults * $10/adult = $60.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQ: At a cafe, each adult coffee costs $3 and children's hot chocolate is free. If a group of 12 people visited and 7 of them were children, how much would it cost for the group to drink?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much it would cost for the group to drink, we need to calculate the total cost of drinks for the adults only, since children's hot chocolate is free. Given that each adult coffee costs $3, we first determine how many adults are in the group. From a total of 12 people, 7 of them are children, so there are 12 - 7 = 5 adults.

Each adult plate costs $6, hence, the total cost for all adult plates is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per plate, which is 8 * $6 = $48. Since salads are free for kids, there is no additional cost for the 12 kids. Thus, the total cost for the group to eat is simply the cost of the adult plates.\nTherefore, the answer is (48)\n\nQ: In a fast food joint, each burger costs $4 and fries come free. If a party of 15 people entered and 9 were kids who ate fries, how much would it cost for the party?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, identify the number of people who consumed burgers. Since 9 kids ate only fries and there were 15 people in total, the number of people who ate burgers is 15 - 9 = 6. Each burger costs $4, therefore the total cost for burgers is 6 * $4 = $24.

If each crate holds 10 cans, how many crates were used to store the sodas?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the store had 300 cans of soda. After selling 180 cans, the remaining cans would be 300 - 180 = 120 cans. To determine the number of crates required to store these cans, we divide the remaining number of cans by the capacity of each crate, which is 10 cans per crate. Therefore, the number of crates required is 120 / 10 = 12 crates.\nTherefore, the answer is (12)\n\nQ: At a pet shelter fundraiser, for every 8 bags of dog food donated, sponsors get one free grooming session. If Emily donated 16 bags and her family donated 32 bags, how many grooming sessions did they get?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we find the total number of bags of dog food donated which is the sum of Emily's and her family's donations. Emily donated 16 bags and her family donated 32 bags, giving a total of 16 + 32 = 48 bags. Next, according to the fundraiser rules, for every 8 bags donated, sponsors get one free grooming session. To find the total number of grooming sessions, divide the total number of bags (48) by the number required for a free session (8). This calculation is 48 / 8 = 6. Therefore, they get six grooming sessions.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: A pet store received an order of 18 bird cages and 22 fish tanks. If only 30 customers wanted cages or tanks, how many extra did the pet store end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of cages and tanks the pet store received. This is done by adding the bird cages and fish tanks received: 18 bird cages + 22 fish tanks = 40 total cages/tanks. Then, compare this total with the number of customers who wanted cages or tanks, which is 30. The difference between the total cages/tanks and the number of interested customers gives the number of extra cages/tanks: 40 total cages/tanks - 30 customers = 10 extra cages/tanks. Hence, the pet store ended up with 10 extra cages or tanks.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQuestion:  A pet store had 64 puppies.

", 'idx': 532, 'prompt': "Q: Rachel’s team won their field hockey game, amassing a total of 35 points. If Rachel scored 17 of these points and her teammates scored 3 points each, how many players were on her team?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the total number of players on Rachel's team be x (including Rachel). Rachel scored 17 points and each of her teammates scored 3 points. The total points scored by Rachel's team is 35 points. Therefore, the equation to find x is: 17 + 3*(x-1) = 35. Subtracting 17 from both sides gives: 3*(x-1) = 18. Dividing both sides by 3 gives: (x-1) = 6. Adding 1 to both sides gives x = 7.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Thomas's team emerged victorious in their hockey game tallying a total of 24 points.

If Jessica netted 28 points and each teammate scored 2 points, how many players were on her team?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet's investigate how many points were scored by players other than Jessica. Jessica scored 28 points, and the total score for the team was 40 points. Therefore, the points scored by the other teammates is 40 - 28 = 12 points. Since each teammate scored 2 points, we can find the number of teammates by dividing the total points scored by the other teammates by the points per teammate, which is 12 / 2 = 6 teammates. Including Jessica, the total number of players on the team is 6 + 1 = 7 players.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nNext, we know that each of the other team members scored 4 points.

Total points scored by the team is 30, and Sophie scored 18 points. Subtracting Sophie's points from the total gives 30 - 18 = 12 points that were scored by other team members. We know each of these remaining team members scored 3 points. To find out how many such team members there were, divide the remaining 12 points by 3 points per team member, which results in 12 / 3 = 4. Counting Sophie and her teammates together, the total number of players on the team is 4 + 1 = 5.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQuestion:  Emily's team won their dodgeball game and scored 39 points total.

They arranged the roses in bouquets with 5 roses in each bouquet. How many bouquets did they make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the florist had 50 roses in stock. Then, they received an additional delivery of 25 roses. To find the total number of roses after the delivery, we add the initial stock of roses to the roses received in the delivery: 50 roses + 25 roses = 75 roses. Next, we need to determine how many bouquets can be made if each bouquet consists of 5 roses. To do this, we divide the total number of roses by the number of roses per bouquet: 75 roses / 5 roses per bouquet = 15 bouquets. Thus, the florist can make 15 bouquets with the available roses.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: A gardener picked 120 roses. She made bouquets with 20 roses and used the remainder for decorating a hall. If decorating the hall requires 10 roses per decoration, how many decorations could she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the number of roses used in the bouquets. If each bouquet contains 20 roses and the gardener made bouquets with these, we get: 120 / 20 = 6 bouquets, using up 6 * 20 = 120 roses. Since all 120 roses are used in the bouquets, there are no remaining roses to use for decorations. Therefore, the number of decorations the gardener can make with the remaining roses is zero because there are no leftover roses.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: Emily is in the garden planting flowers. She has 60 flowers to plant, but her friend plants 5 of them.

If Lisa and her club collected 40 bottles while another group collected 8 bottles, how many points were earned in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate how many points each group earned based on the number of bottles they collected. Since for every 4 bottles one point is earned, we divide the number of bottles each group collected by 4 and then sum these points up. Lisa and her club collected 40 bottles, so the points they earned are 40 / 4 = 10 points. The other group collected 8 bottles, so their points are 8 / 4 = 2 points. Adding these together gives a total of 10 + 2 = 12 points.\nTherefore, the answer is (12)\n\nQ: Alice was distributing snacks at a party. She had 65 snacks, served 45 in the main dining area, and shared the remaining snacks among smaller groups, with each group receiving 5 snacks. How many smaller groups received snacks?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nAlice initially had 65 snacks. She distributed 45 snacks in the main dining area, leaving her with 65 - 45 = 20 snacks. These remaining snacks were to be divided among smaller groups, with each group receiving 5 snacks. To find the number of smaller groups, we divide the remaining number of snacks by the amount each group receives, 20 / 5 = 4.

If each player who did play scored 10 points, how many points were recorded in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, a basketball team should have 5 players starting, but 1 player was absent due to sickness, leaving 4 players. If each of these 4 players scored 10 points each, then the total number of points scored by the team is calculated by multiplying the number of players who played by the points each player scored, which is 4 players multiplied by 10 points.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: Rachel’s team won their field hockey game, amassing a total of 35 points. If Rachel scored 17 of these points and her teammates scored 3 points each, how many players were on her team?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the total number of players on Rachel's team be x (including Rachel). Rachel scored 17 points and each of her teammates scored 3 points. The total points scored by Rachel's team is 35 points. Therefore, the equation to find x is: 17 + 3*(x-1) = 35. Subtracting 17 from both sides gives: 3*(x-1) = 18. Dividing both sides by 3 gives: (x-1) = 6. Adding 1 to both sides gives x = 7.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Sophie's team secured a win in their tennis match and scored a total of 30 points. If Sophie earned 18 points and all other team members earned 3 points each, how many players were on her team?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo figure out the number of players on Sophie's team, start by deducting Sophie's points from the total team score. Total points scored by the team is 30, and Sophie scored 18 points. Subtracting Sophie's points from the total gives 30 - 18 = 12 points that were scored by other team members. We know each of these remaining team members scored 3 points. To find out how many such team members there were, divide the remaining 12 points by 3 points per team member, which results in 12 / 3 = 4. Counting Sophie and her teammates together, the total number of players on the team is 4 + 1 = 5.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: In a basketball game, Jessica's team scored a total of 92 points. If Jessica scored 50 of those points and the other team members scored 7 points each, how many players were on Jessica's team?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine the total points scored by the other players on Jessica's team by subtracting the points Jessica scored from the team's total: 92 - 50 = 42 points. Next, since each of the other players scored 7 points, we divide the total points scored by the other players by the points each player scored to find the number of other players: 42 / 7 = 6 other players. Since these are just the other players, and Jessica is also part of the team, we add 1 to include her in the total count of players on the team: 6 + 1 = 7 players.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Anna's team won their volleyball game scoring a total of 45 points.

The total points scored by the team were 66. So, the points scored by others were 66 - 42 = 24 points. Assuming everyone else scored 3 points each, we divide the remaining points by 3 to find the number of other players. That is 24 / 3 = 8 players. Including Luke, the total number of players on the team is 8 + 1 = 9.\nTherefore, the answer is (9)\n\nQuestion:  Bianca's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total.
