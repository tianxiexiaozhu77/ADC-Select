To find out how many shelves Oliver needs, divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold: 36 books / 4 books per shelf = 9 shelves. Therefore, Oliver will need 9 shelves to fit all the books.\nTherefore, the answer is (9).\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe store initially had 40 coloring books. After putting 20 of them on sale, they were left with 40 - 20 = 20 coloring books. These remaining 20 books were then organized onto shelves with 4 books each. To find out how many shelves were used, we divide the total number of remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 20 / 4 = 5. Therefore, 5 shelves were used to store the remaining books.\nTherefore, the answer is (5).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nEdward initially had 35 games and sold 19 of them. To find out how many games are left, we subtract the number of games sold from the total number of games he originally had, which is 35 - 19 = 16 games. Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack these remaining games, with each box holding 8 games. To find this, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold, which is 16 / 8 = 2. Therefore, Edward needs to use 2 boxes to pack the remaining games.\nTherefore, the answer is (2).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

Next, determine the total cost by multiplying the number of tickets (8) by the cost per ticket (4 dollars), which results in 8 * 4 = 32 dollars. Therefore, Haley spent a total of 32 dollars on tickets.\nTherefore, the answer is (32).\n\nQuestion:  Ned was trying to expand his game collection.

To find out how many shelves were used, we divide the total number of remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 20 / 4 = 5. Therefore, 5 shelves were used to store the remaining books.\nTherefore, the answer is (5).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nEdward initially had 35 games and sold 19 of them. To find out how many games are left, we subtract the number of games sold from the total number of games he originally had, which is 35 - 19 = 16 games. Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack these remaining games, with each box holding 8 games. To find this, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold, which is 16 / 8 = 2. Therefore, Edward needs to use 2 boxes to pack the remaining games.\nTherefore, the answer is (2).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nEdward initially had 35 games and sold 19 of them. To find out how many games are left, we subtract the number of games sold from the total number of games he originally had, which is 35 - 19 = 16 games. Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack these remaining games, with each box holding 8 games. To find this, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold, which is 16 / 8 = 2. Therefore, Edward needs to use 2 boxes to pack the remaining games.\nTherefore, the answer is (2).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves Oliver needs, divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold: 36 books / 4 books per shelf = 9 shelves. Therefore, Oliver will need 9 shelves to fit all the books.\nTherefore, the answer is (9).\n\nQ:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe store initially had 40 coloring books. After putting 20 of them on sale, they were left with 40 - 20 = 20 coloring books. These remaining 20 books were then organized onto shelves with 4 books each. To find out how many shelves were used, we divide the total number of remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 20 / 4 = 5. Therefore, 5 shelves were used to store the remaining books.\nTherefore, the answer is (5).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nEdward initially had 35 games and sold 19 of them. To find out how many games are left, we subtract the number of games sold from the total number of games he originally had, which is 35 - 19 = 16 games. Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack these remaining games, with each box holding 8 games. To find this, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold, which is 16 / 8 = 2. Therefore, Edward needs to use 2 boxes to pack the remaining games.\nTherefore, the answer is (2).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves Oliver needs, divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold: 36 books / 4 books per shelf = 9 shelves.

They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe store initially had 40 coloring books. After putting 20 of them on sale, they were left with 40 - 20 = 20 coloring books. These remaining 20 books were then organized onto shelves with 4 books each. To find out how many shelves were used, we divide the total number of remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 20 / 4 = 5. Therefore, 5 shelves were used to store the remaining books.\nTherefore, the answer is (5).\n\nQ:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nEdward initially had 35 games and sold 19 of them. To find out how many games are left, we subtract the number of games sold from the total number of games he originally had, which is 35 - 19 = 16 games. Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack these remaining games, with each box holding 8 games. To find this, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold, which is 16 / 8 = 2. Therefore, Edward needs to use 2 boxes to pack the remaining games.\nTherefore, the answer is (2).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.

To find out how many shelves Oliver needs, divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold: 36 books / 4 books per shelf = 9 shelves.

He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nEdward initially had 35 games and sold 19 of them. To find out how many games are left, we subtract the number of games sold from the total number of games he originally had, which is 35 - 19 = 16 games. Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack these remaining games, with each box holding 8 games. To find this, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold, which is 16 / 8 = 2. Therefore, Edward needs to use 2 boxes to pack the remaining games.\nTherefore, the answer is (2).\n\nQ:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each.
