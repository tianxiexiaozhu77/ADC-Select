There are 46 book to put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with the rest. If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nOliver starts with 46 books. A librarian takes 10 books, leaving Oliver with 46 - 10 = 36 books. Each shelf can hold 4 books. To find out how many shelves are needed, divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold: 36 divided by 4 equals 9. Therefore, Oliver will need 9 shelves to store all the books.\nTherefore, the answer is (9).\n\nQ:  Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera to facebook.

If Paige scored 11 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "First, we need to determine how many points were scored by players other than Paige. Since Paige scored 11 points and the total score was 41 points, we can find the points scored by the other players by subtracting Paige's points from the total:\\n\\n41 points (total) - 11 points (Paige) = 30 points scored by the other players.\\n\\nNext, we need to figure out how many players scored these 30 points if each of them scored 6 points. To do this, we divide the total points scored by the other players by the points each player scored:\\n\\n30 points ÷ 6 points per player = 5 players.\\n\\nNow, we must include Paige in the total count of players on her team. So, we add Paige to the number of other players:\\n\\n5 players (other) + 1 (Paige) = 6 players on the team.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is (6).", 'true_answer': [5.0]}
