The school cafeteria ordered a total of 33 red apples and 23 green apples. To find the total number of apples ordered, we add these two amounts together:\\n   - Total apples = 33 red apples + 23 green apples = 56 apples.\\n\\n2. If only 21 students wanted fruit, we need to determine how many apples were not taken by the students. Since each student can take one apple, the number of apples taken is 21.\\n\\n3. To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we subtract the number of apples taken from the total number of apples ordered:\\n   - Extra apples = Total apples - Apples taken = 56 apples - 21 apples = 35 apples.\\n\\nTherefore, the cafeteria ended up with 35 extra apples.", 'true_answer': [35.0]}

Since Dave can only carry 9 trays at a time, we will divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry in one trip:\\n\\n72 trays ÷ 9 trays per trip = 8 trips.\\n\\nNow, let's check if he has to make a full trip with any remainder. Since 72 is exactly divisible by 9, he does not need to make an extra trip for any remaining trays.\\n\\nTherefore, Dave will need to make a total of 8 trips to pick up all the trays.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is (8).", 'true_answer': [8.0]}
