If she only ate 9 pieces a day, we can use simple subtraction to find out how long the candy will last her. ü§î\n\nLet's start by writing down the information we know:\n\n5 + 13 = 18 (pieces of candy Emily received)\n9 (number of pieces Emily eats per day)\n\nNow, we need to find out how many days the candy will last Emily. We can divide the total number of pieces of candy by the number of pieces she eats per day:\n\n18 √∑ 9 = 2 (days)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (5.0). üòÉ\n\nSo, Emily's candy will last her for 2 days if she eats 9 pieces per day. üéâ\n\nI hope that helps, my dear!
