Here are the answers to the questions:\n\nQ: Tiffany uploaded 7 pictures from her phone and 13 from her camera to Facebook. If she sorted the pics into 5 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums?\nA: Let's think step by step. Tiffany uploaded a total of 20 pictures (7 from her phone + 13 from her camera). To divide them evenly among 5 albums, we can divide 20 by 5, which equals 4. Therefore, each album would have 4 pictures. So, the answer is (4.0).\n\nQ: Oliver is at the library helping put away books. There are 46 books to put away total, but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with the rest. If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need?\nA: Let's think step by step. The librarian takes 10 books, leaving Oliver with 36 books to put away (46 - 10 = 36). Since he can fit 4 books on a shelf, he will need 36 / 4 = 9 shelves to put away all the books. So, the answer is (9.0).\n\nQ: Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera to Facebook. If she sorted the pics into 8 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums?\nA: Let's think step by step. First, add up the total number of pictures uploaded: 5 + 35 = 40. Then, divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums: 40 / 8 = 5. Therefore, the answer is (5.0).\n\nQ: Vanessa and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Vanessa picked 17 and her mother picked 14. If only 24 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?\nA: Let's think step by step. If Vanessa picked 17 good carrots and her mother picked 14 good carrots, together they picked 31 good carrots (17 + 14 = 31). If only 24 of the carrots were good, then the number of bad carrots is 31 - 24 = 7. Therefore, the answer is (7.0).", 'true_answer': [7.0]}

During a sale, they sold 15 cats. How many cats do they have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. üê±\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many cats the pet store had originally. We know that the total number of Siamese cats is 41, and the total number of house cats is 28. So, the total number of cats is 41 + 28 = 69 cats.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many cats were sold during the sale. We are given that 15 cats were sold.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many cats the pet store has left. To do this, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats the pet store had. So, 69 - 15 = 54 cats.\n\nTherefore, the pet store has 54 cats left. üê±\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. üòä", 'true_answer': [54.0]}

If she sorted the pics into 5 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums?\nA: Let's think step by step. Tiffany uploaded a total of 20 pictures (7 from her phone + 13 from her camera). If she sorted them into 5 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, we can divide the total number of pictures by 5: 20 / 5 = 4. Therefore, each album would have 4 pictures.

So, each album will have 5 pictures. Therefore, the answer is (5.0).\n\nQ: At lunch a waiter had 7 customers and 4 of them didn't leave a tip. If he got $9 each from the ones who did tip, how much money did he earn?\nA: Excellent question! Let's use our problem-solving skills to solve this one. If the waiter had 7 customers and 4 of them didn't leave a tip, that means 7 - 4 = 3 customers left a tip. If each customer who left a tip gave $9, then the total amount of money the waiter earned from tips is 3 x $9 = $27. Therefore, the answer is ($27.0).", 'true_answer': [27.0]}
