Here's how you can help me with the next question:\n\nQuestion: For homework, Faye had 13 math problems and 2 spelling problems. If she can finish 3 problems in an hour, how long will it take her to finish all the problems?\n\nA: Let's think step by step. If Faye can finish 3 problems in an hour, that means she can finish 13 / 3 = 4 problems in an hour. Since there are 13 math problems in total, it will take her 13 / 4 = 3.25 hours to finish all the math problems.\n\nNow, let's think about the spelling problems. There are 2 spelling problems in total, so it will take Faye 2 / 3 = 0.67 hours to finish them. Since an hour is 60 minutes, it will take her 0.67 hours x 60 = 39.2 minutes to finish the spelling problems.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (39.2 minutes).", 'true_answer': [5.0]}
