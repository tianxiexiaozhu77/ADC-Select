But, if only 2 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we need to first find out how many apples were given to the students. Since only 2 students wanted fruit, they would have received 2 apples in total. \n\nSince the apples are of two different colors, we can assume that each student got one of each color. So, the 2 students would have received 1 red apple and 1 green apple each. \n\nNow, let's add up the total number of apples given to the students: 2 students * 2 apples/student = 4 apples.\n\nNow, let's find out how many apples the cafeteria had in total: 43 red apples + 32 green apples = 75 apples.\n\nTo find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we need to subtract the number of apples given to the students from the total number of apples: 75 - 4 = 71.\n\nTherefore, the cafeteria ended up with 71 extra apples.", 'true_answer': [73.0]}

Since they earn 1 point for every 3 pounds, we divide 11 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pounds she recycled: 11 / 3 = 3.67. Since you can't recycle a fraction of a set, we round down to 3 sets. However, since 3 sets would be 9 pounds, and Haley recycled 11 pounds, she must have recycled 2 more pounds in the 4th set. 2 pounds is less than 3 pounds, so she only gets 3 points for the 3 full sets and 0 points for the 4th set. Therefore, Haley earned 3 points.\n\nHaley's friends recycled 16 pounds. We divide 16 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pounds they recycled: 16 / 3 = 5.33. Since you can't recycle a fraction of a set, we round down to 5 sets. However, since 5 sets would be 15 pounds, and her friends recycled 16 pounds, they must have recycled 1 more pound in the 6th set. 1 pound is less than 3 pounds, so they only get 5 points for the 5 full sets and 0 points for the 6th set. Therefore, Haley's friends earned 5 points.\n\nTo find the total points earned, we add the points earned by Haley and her friends: 3 + 5 = 8. Therefore, the answer is (8.0).", 'true_answer': [9.0]}

If each one costs $6, how much money would he need to finish his collection? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "To find out how much money John needs to finish his collection, we first need to determine how many more action figures he needs. He already has 6, but he needs 11 for a complete collection. \n\n6 (he has) - 11 (he needs) = -5 \n\nSince you can't have a negative number of action figures, this means John actually needs 5 more action figures. \n\nNow, we need to find out how much money he needs to buy these 5 action figures. Each action figure costs $6, so we multiply the number of action figures he needs by the cost of each one: \n\n5 (action figures needed) * 6 (cost per action figure) = 30\n\nTherefore, John needs $30 to finish his collection.", 'true_answer': [30.0]}
