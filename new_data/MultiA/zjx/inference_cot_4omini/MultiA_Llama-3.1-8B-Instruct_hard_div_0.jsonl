There are 40 students and 14 adults, so the total number of people is 40 + 14 = 54. \n\nSince each van can hold 9 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 9 to find out how many vans are needed. 54 / 9 = 6. \n\nHowever, since you can't have a fraction of a van, and 54 is not exactly divisible by 9, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we need 6 vans to accommodate all the students and adults.", 'true_answer': [6.0]}

Each room takes 7 hours to paint, so the total time to paint the remaining rooms is 9 x 7 = 63 hours. \n\nSince the painter has already spent some time painting, we need to subtract that from the total time to find out how much longer he will take.

Since she already baked 7, she needs 16 - 7 = 9 more brownies. \n\nFor each brownie, she uses 6 cups of flour. So, for 9 more brownies, she will need 9 x 6 = 54 cups of flour.\n\nTo find out how much flour she still needs, we subtract the amount she used from the amount she needs: 54 - 42 = 12 cups of flour.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (12.0)', 'true_answer': [54.0]}

If Katie scored 4 of the points and everyone else scored 4 points each, how many players were on her team? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "Let's think step by step.\n\nWe know that Katie scored 4 points and the total points scored by the team is 12. If everyone else scored 4 points each, we can represent the number of other players as 'x'. \n\nThe total points scored by the other players would be 4x. \n\nSince the total points scored by the team is 12, we can set up the equation: \n4 + 4x = 12\n\nTo solve for x, we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: \n4x = 12 - 4\n4x = 8\n\nNow, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to find the value of x: \nx = 8 / 4\nx = 2\n\nThis means there are 2 other players on Katie's team, in addition to Katie herself. So, the total number of players on her team is 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (3.0)", 'true_answer': [2.0]}
