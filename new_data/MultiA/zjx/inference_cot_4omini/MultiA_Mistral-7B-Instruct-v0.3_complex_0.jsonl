How many cats do they have left? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "First, let's find out how many cats were sold. In this case, 20 siamese cats and 0 house cats were sold (since the question doesn't mention any house cats being sold). So, a total of 20 cats were sold.\n\nNow, let's find out how many cats are left. Since no information is given about the number of cats that died or were added, we can only subtract the number of cats that were sold from the initial number of cats. So, the number of cats left is 12 (siamese cats) - 20 (sold cats) = -8. However, since it's impossible to have a negative number of cats, it seems there might be a mistake in the question or the provided answer.\n\nIt's likely that the question should have mentioned the number of house cats instead of only siamese cats when calculating the total number of cats sold. In that case, the number of cats left would be 12 (siamese cats) + 20 (house cats) - 20 (sold cats) = 32 cats.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be (32.0) or (32), but the provided answer seems incorrect due to the lack of information about the house cats.", 'true_answer': [12.0]}

Since there are only 23 green apples, the cafeteria would have 23 - 21 = 2 extra green apples.\n\nSince we don't know the actual distribution of apples among the students, we can't determine the exact number of extra apples. However, we know that there are at least 2 extra green apples and at least 12 extra red apples.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (at least 2 extra green apples and at least 12 extra red apples).", 'true_answer': [35.0]}

But, if only 21 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "First, let's find out the total number of apples ordered: 33 red apples + 23 green apples = 56 apples.\n\nNext, let's find out how many apples were needed for the 21 students: Since we don't know the ratio of red to green apples that each student wanted, we can't determine the exact number of apples for each student. However, we can find out the maximum number of apples that could have been given to the 21 students.\n\nTo do this, let's assume that all 21 students wanted only red apples. In this case, the maximum number of apples that could have been given would be 21 red apples. Since there are only 33 red apples, the cafeteria would have 33 - 21 = 12 extra red apples.\n\nOn the other hand, if all 21 students wanted only green apples, the maximum number of apples that could have been given would be 21 green apples. Since there are only 23 green apples, the cafeteria would have 23 - 21 = 2 extra green apples.\n\nSince we don't know the actual distribution of apples among the students, we can't determine the exact number of extra apples. However, we know that there are at least 2 extra green apples and at least 12 extra red apples.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (at least 2 extra green apples and at least 12 extra red apples).", 'true_answer': [35.0]}

To find the total number of people in line after these changes, we subtract the number of people who left from the original number of people in line, and then add the number of people who joined: 31 (original) - 25 (left) + 25 (joined) = 31.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the number of people in line after the changes, we should not include the original number of people in line in our calculation.

If you had 7 carnations and 47 roses, how many vases would you need to hold the flowers? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "First, let's find out how many carnations can be placed in vases. Since one vase can hold 6 flowers and carnations are the only type of flowers given in the question, we can determine the number of vases needed for carnations by dividing the number of carnations by the number of flowers each vase can hold: 7 carnations / 6 flowers per vase = 1 vase for carnations.\n\nNext, let's find out how many roses can be placed in vases. Since there is only one vase for carnations, we can calculate the number of vases needed for roses by dividing the number of roses by the number of flowers each vase can hold, and subtracting the number of vases already used for carnations: 47 roses - (1 vase * 6 flowers per vase) = 41 roses / 6 flowers per vase = 6 vases and 5 flowers left over.\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a vase, we will need to round up and use an additional vase to hold the 5 leftover flowers. Therefore, the total number of vases needed is 1 (for carnations) + 7 (for roses) = 8 vases.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (8.0) vases.", 'true_answer': [9.0]}

The number of trips for the second table is 55 / 9, which equals approximately 6.11. Again, since he can't make a fraction of a trip, we'll round up to 7 trips for the second table.\n\nFinally, let's add the number of trips for both tables to find the total number of trips Dave will make. So, 2 trips (for the first table) + 7 trips (for the second table) equals 9 trips in total.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (9.0) trips.", 'true_answer': [8.0]}

Since we can't have a fraction of a load, Sarah will need to do 9 loads for the shirts (8 full loads and 1 with 3 shirts left).\n\nNext, let's find out how many loads she needs for the sweaters. Since there are only 2 sweaters, she will need to do 1 load for the sweaters.\n\nFinally, let's add the number of loads for the shirts and the sweaters together: 9 (shirts) + 1 (sweaters) = 10 loads.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (10.0) loads.", 'true_answer': [9.0]}

Since each of those tables had 8 people, there were initially 12 * 8 = 96 people on those tables.\n\nNow, subtract the 96 people from the total number of customers to find out how many tables the waiter originally had: 44 - 96 = -52. Since we cannot have a negative number of tables, it seems there might be a mistake in the question.

She uploaded a total of 65 pictures, so the number of pictures left is 65 - 17 = 48.\n\nNow, she put the rest into 6 different albums. Since there are 48 pictures left and she has 6 albums, we can divide the remaining pictures by the number of albums: 48 / 6 = 8.\n\nTherefore, each of the 6 albums would have 8 pictures. However, since one album already has 17 pictures, the remaining 5 albums would each have 8 - 17 (from the first album) = -9 pictures. Since it's not possible to have a negative number of pictures, there seems to be a mistake in the question.\n\nTo clarify, it seems that the question should have stated that Haley put the rest into 5 different albums instead of 6. In that case, each of the 5 albums would have 8 pictures, and the first album would have 17 pictures.\n\nTherefore, the corrected answer is: The first album would have 17 pictures, and each of the 5 remaining albums would have 8 pictures.\n\nTherefore, the corrected answer is (17, 8.0).", 'true_answer': [8.0]}
