Robin has a total of 23 + 25 = 48 cookies.\n\nSince she puts 6 cookies in each bag, we can find out how many baggies she can make by dividing the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per bag: 48 / 6 = 8.\n\nHowever, since there are not enough chocolate chip cookies for 8 baggies, Robin can only make 7 baggies of chocolate chip cookies.\n\nFor the remaining cookie (48 - 23 = 25), she can make 4 baggies (25 / 6 = 4.166666666666667, but since she can't have a fraction of a baggie, she can only make 4 baggies).\n\nSo, Robin can make a total of 7 baggies of chocolate chip cookies and 4 baggies of oatmeal cookies, for a total of 11 baggies.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (11.0) baggies.", 'true_answer': [8.0]}

Since the washing machine can wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time, we can wash 43 shirts in 43 / 5 = 8.6 loads. However, since we can't have a fraction of a load, we'll round up to 9 loads for the shirts.\n\nNext, let's find out how many loads are needed for the sweaters. Since there are only 2 sweaters, we can wash them in 1 load.\n\nFinally, let's add the number of loads for the shirts and the sweaters together. 9 (shirts) + 1 (sweaters) = 10 loads in total.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (10.0) loads.", 'true_answer': [9.0]}

She baked 71 cupcakes, and Todd ate 43, so Megan has 71 - 43 = 28 cupcakes left.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many packages she can make with the remaining cupcakes. If she puts 7 cupcakes in each package, then she can make 28 / 7 = approximately 4 packages (with a remainder of 1 cupcake).\n\nHowever, since we cannot have a fraction of a package, Megan will need to make 4 full packages and use the remaining cupcake separately.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (4.0) packages, with an additional (1.0) cupcake.', 'true_answer': [4.0]}

If he spent 47 bucks on a new game, how many 7 dollar toys could he buy with the money he had left? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "First, we need to find out how much money Roger has left after buying the new game. He started with 68 dollars and spent 47 dollars on the game, so he has 68 - 47 = 21 dollars left.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many 7-dollar toys he can buy with the money he has left. Since 7 dollars is the same as 0.07 times the total amount of money, we can divide the amount of money he has left by 0.07 to find out how many 7-dollar toys he can buy.\n\nSo, 21 / 0.07 = 294.29 (rounded to two decimal places). Since we can't buy a fraction of a toy, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (294.0) toys. However, since we can't buy a fraction of a toy, the actual number of toys Roger can buy is 294. But since the question asks for the number of 7-dollar toys, we'll leave the answer as (294.0) to indicate that the exact number of toys he can buy is 294.", 'true_answer': [3.0]}
