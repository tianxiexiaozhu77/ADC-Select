If she used 7 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "To determine how many cups of flour Zoe still needs, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of flour Zoe has already used.\n2. Determine how much more flour she needs by subtracting the amount she has already used from the total amount required.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of flour Zoe has already used. She baked 5 brownies, and each brownie requires 7 cups of flour. Therefore, the total amount of flour used is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ brownies} \\times 7 \\text{ cups of flour per brownie} = 35 \\text{ cups of flour} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how much more flour Zoe needs. She needs a total of 11 brownies, and each brownie requires 7 cups of flour. Therefore, the total amount of flour required is:\n\\[ 11 \\text{ brownies} \\times 7 \\text{ cups of flour per brownie} = 77 \\text{ cups of flour} \\]\n\nSince Zoe has already used 35 cups of flour, the amount of flour she still needs is:\n\\[ 77 \\text{ cups of flour} - 35 \\text{ cups of flour} = 42 \\text{ cups of flour} \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{42}\n\\]", 'true_answer': [42.0]}

Determine how many 4 dollar toys he can buy with the remaining money.\n\nFirst, we start with the initial amount of money Will had, which is 83 dollars. He spent 47 dollars on a new game. So, we subtract the amount spent from the initial amount:\n\\[ 83 - 47 = 36 \\]\nWill has 36 dollars left after buying the game.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many 4 dollar toys he can buy with the 36 dollars he has left. We do this by dividing the remaining amount of money by the cost of one toy:\n\\[ 36 \\div 4 = 9 \\]\nWill can buy 9 toys with the 36 dollars he has left.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4 dollar toys Will can buy is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).', 'true_answer': [9.0]}
