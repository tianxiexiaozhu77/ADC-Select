First, we calculate the points Wendy earns from the first level:\n   - Wendy finds 4 treasures on the first level.\n   - Each treasure is worth 5 points.\n   - Therefore, the points from the first level are \\(4 \\times 5 = 20\\).\n\n2. Next, we calculate the points Wendy earns from the second level:\n   - Wendy finds 3 treasures on the second level.\n   - Each treasure is worth 5 points.\n   - Therefore, the points from the second level are \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\).\n\n3. Finally, we add the points from both levels to get Wendy's total score:\n   - Points from the first level: 20\n   - Points from the second level: 15\n   - Total score: \\(20 + 15 = 35\\)\n\nThus, Wendy's total score is \\(\\boxed{35}\\).", 'true_answer': [35.0]}

Calculate the cost of the adult meals.\n2. Calculate the cost of the children's meals.\n3. Add the costs of the adult and children's meals together.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost of the adult meals. Since each adult meal costs $3 and there are 2 adults, the total cost for the adult meals is:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ adults} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars/adult} = 6 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the cost of the children's meals. Since each child's meal costs $3 and there are 5 children, the total cost for the children's meals is:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ children} \\times 3 \\text{ dollars/child} = 15 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nNow, we add the costs of the adult and children's meals together to find the total bill:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ dollars} + 15 \\text{ dollars} = 21 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total bill is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).", 'true_answer': [21.0]}
