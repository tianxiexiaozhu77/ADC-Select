However, he only used 50 of these flowers for the wedding arrangement. This means he did not use 100 - 50 = 50 flowers. Since the question asks how many additional flowers he picked over the amount he used, and he utilized 50 of the 100 flowers he picked, there are no additional flowers needed beyond what he has picked already. Thus, the answer is that he picked no additional flowers beyond the 50 used for the arrangement.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQuestion:  Lana picked 36 tulips and 37 roses to make flower bouquets.

However, if only 50 customers bought items, how many extra did the store have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe grocery store ordered 80 loaves of bread and 30 bags of chips. If only 50 customers bought items, we need to determine how many items were sold. Assuming each customer bought one item (either a loaf of bread or a bag of chips), a total of 50 items were sold. We then compare this to the total items ordered. The store ordered 80 loaves of bread + 30 bags of chips = 110 items in total. Subtracting the items sold from the total ordered: 110 items - 50 items = 60 items left over. Thus, the store has 60 extra items remaining after the promotion.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQ: Sophie and her uncle were pulling onions from their patch.

Therefore, she has a total of 50 + 50 = 100 sketches in the two sketchbooks we are aware of. The other two sketchbooks remain unspecified in terms of the number of sketches. After ten days, she completed 25 sketches. To find out how many sketches remain to be sketched from the known sketches, we take the total sketches she has (100) and subtract the completed ones (25). Thus, remaining sketches = 100 - 25 = 75 sketches.

To find the total number of games after the trades, we can subtract the traded games from the new ones: 6 - 12 = -6. This indicates he has traded away more than he acquired. However, it seems he's gained new games despite trading. For calculating playable games, we know 4 of the games were scratched. Since he acquired 6 games, we now check if any of the games are playable.

Sara picked 40 berries and her mom picked 15 berries. Therefore, the total number of berries is 40 + 15 = 55. Next, we know that out of these 55 berries, only 25 were sweet. To find out how many were sour, we subtract the number of sweet berries from the total number of berries. So, 55 - 25 = 30. This means there were 30 sour berries.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\nQ: Sofia wanted to improve her craft supplies. She collected 25 items from a friend and bought 10 more at a craft fair. If 8 of them were unusable, how many good items did she have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSofia initially collected 25 items from a friend. After that, she bought 10 more items at a craft fair. So, the total number of items she had was 25 + 10 = 35 items. However, out of these 35 items, 8 were unusable. To find the number of usable items, we need to subtract the unusable items from the total items: 35 - 8 = 27 usable items. Therefore, the number of good items she had left is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27)\n\nQ: Sophie and her uncle were pulling onions from their patch. Sophie pulled 15 and her uncle pulled 10.

If only 20 of the apples were ripe, how many unripe apples did they have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLucas picked 30 apples and his dad picked 12 apples, which gives a total of 30 + 12 = 42 apples. Out of these, only 20 apples were ripe. To find the number of unripe apples, we need to subtract the number of ripe apples from the total number of apples.

Yet, if only 10 customers came in, how many extra products did the store have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe grocery store ordered 100 loaves of bread and 50 bags of chips. The total ordered was 100 + 50 = 150 products. If only 10 customers came in, we need to determine how many products each customer could have purchased. Let's assume each customer could buy an equal number of products; however, we don't know the specifics of the purchase per customer. To calculate the extra products, we should focus on what was ordered versus what could possibly be sold. Since we don't have any specific data on how many products were actually sold to those 10 customers, we cannot accurately determine the number of extra products. Therefore, realistically, there are still the original 150 products that were ordered with no data on the sales. Thus, we cannot conclude any products were sold or extra without further information. Therefore, the remaining products must be all that was ordered; hence this leads back to the conclusion that there are no given sales data, indicating we cannot quantify any surplus beyond the initial order.\nTherefore, the answer is (150)\n\nQ: The plant nursery brought in 25 flower pots and 10 garden tools for a sale. But, if only 15 people attended the sale, how many extra items were left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of items brought in by the nursery. There are 25 flower pots and 10 garden tools. So, the total number of items is 25 + 10 = 35. Next, we consider the number of people attending the sale, which is 15. If each person bought one item, then the total number of items sold would be 15. Now, we subtract the number of items sold from the total number of items: 35 - 15 = 20. Thus, there are 20 extra items left after the sale.\nTherefore, the answer is (20)\n\nQ: The art supply store stocked 40 paint tubes and 15 brushes for an art class. However, if only 10 students signed up for the class, how many extra supplies did the store end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe art supply store has 40 paint tubes and 15 brushes. If 10 students signed up for the class, we need to determine how many supplies each student would need. Assuming each student needs one paint tube and one brush, the total supplies required would be 10 paint tubes and 10 brushes. To find out how many extra supplies there are, we can subtract the required amounts from the amounts stocked. For paint tubes: 40 - 10 = 30 extra paint tubes. For brushes: 15 - 10 = 5 extra brushes. Therefore, the total number of extra supplies is 30 + 5 = 35 extra supplies.\nTherefore, the answer is (35)\n\nQ: Tom had to prepare 12 sandwiches and 25 salads for the picnic. If he had only made 23 of them by the time the picnic started, how many did he not prepare?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTom needed to prepare a total of 12 sandwiches and 25 salads. First, we calculate the total number of items he needed to prepare: 12 (sandwiches) + 25 (salads) = 37 items. By the time the picnic started, he had only made 23 of these items. To find out how many items he did not prepare, we subtract the number of items he made from the total number needed: 37 - 23 = 14 items not prepared. Therefore, he did not prepare 14 items in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (14)\n\nQ: The ice cream shop made 100 cones and 50 sundaes for a festival. But, if only 70 customers wanted ice cream, how many extras did the shop have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe ice cream shop made a total of 100 cones and 50 sundaes, which means they prepared 150 items for the festival. However, only 70 customers wanted ice cream. The excess amount can be calculated by subtracting the number of customers who wanted ice cream from the total items. Therefore, total items made (150) - customers wanting ice cream (70) = 80 extras. Thus, the shop had 80 items left after serving the customers.\nTherefore, the answer is (80)\n\nQ: The grocery store ordered 80 loaves of bread and 30 bags of chips for a promotion. However, if only 50 customers bought items, how many extra did the store have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe grocery store ordered 80 loaves of bread and 30 bags of chips, giving us a total of 80 + 30 = 110 items. If 50 customers bought items, we need to determine how many items were left. Since 50 items were purchased, the total number of items that remain is 110 - 50 = 60 items. Therefore, the store has 60 extra items remaining after the promotion.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQ: Liam had to prepare 18 apple pies and 22 cherry pies for the bake sale.

He had to prepare 18 apple pies and 22 cherry pies. The total number of pies is 18 + 22 = 40 pies. Next, we look at how many pies Liam actually baked before the sale started. He only baked 10 pies. To find out how many pies he did not bake, we subtract the number of pies he baked from the total number of pies required. Therefore, the number of pies not baked is 40 - 10 = 30 pies.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\nQuestion:  The school cafeteria ordered 43 red apples and 32 green apples for students lunches.

If she completed 15 of the tasks in her study group, how many assignments must she still finish for homework?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmma has 20 reading tasks and 10 writing assignments. She completed 15 reading tasks in her study group. To find out how many assignments she still needs to finish for homework, we should first determine the total number of assignments minus the number she has completed. Since the question only explicitly mentions the reading tasks completed and does not imply any writing assignments were completed, we can assume she still has all writing assignments left to complete. Therefore, the total remaining assignments consist of the writing tasks. Emma has 10 writing assignments remaining, and since no reading tasks remain to be completed for homework (15 out of 20 completed), we only count the writing assignments. Hence, the total number of assignments she must still finish is 10.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: James received 32 physics problems and 8 biology assignments for his homework.

Since she was assigned 25 problems and completed 20 in class, we subtract 20 from 25. This gives us 5 remaining chemistry problems. Additionally, she has 5 physics questions that she hasn't started yet. Therefore, the total questions she has to complete at home are the remaining chemistry problems plus the physics questions: 5 (remaining chemistry) + 5 (physics) = 10. Thus, Ava needs to complete 10 questions at home.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Sophia received 36 history essays and 24 geography projects for her studies. If she finished 40 of them during study time, how many projects did she still need to complete for homework?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSophia received a total of 36 history essays and 24 geography projects. This sums up to 36 + 24 = 60 total assignments. She finished 40 of these assignments during study time. Therefore, the number of assignments she has left to complete is 60 - 40 = 20. Since all projects were completed during study time, there are no specific projects left to complete. Thus, the number of projects she still needs to complete for homework is derived from the total remaining assignments, which is 20 minus any similarity by type. However, since there were exactly 20 because the question does not indicate a separation, she completed all types during study time, leading to the conclusion that she needs to complete none.

However, if only 50 customers bought items, how many extra did the store have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe grocery store ordered 80 loaves of bread and 30 bags of chips. There were 50 customers who bought items. To find out how many extras the store had, we need to first assume that each customer bought at least one loaf of bread or one bag of chips. If 50 customers bought items, it is possible that they bought bread and chips but we do not have specific customer purchase data. However, to determine if there are any extras, we need to compare the total number of items ordered with the total number of customers. If 50 customers bought a minimum of 50 items, at least some items would still be remaining in comparison to what was ordered. Therefore, we need to consider how many loaves and bags were potentially remaining after accounting for the 50 customers. If we don’t know how many of each product was sold, we can assume that not all products were bought. Therefore, since there were more items ordered than customers who purchased them, there were items left over or extra items. Hence, there are extras available after the sales to customers.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQ: Jake and his dad were collecting apples from their orchard. Jake picked 15 and his dad picked 7.

However, if only 22 customers bought fruit, how many extra pieces did the vendor have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of fruits the vendor brought to the market. He had 40 oranges and 35 bananas. Combining these gives: 40 + 35 = 75 fruits in total. Next, we know that 22 customers bought fruit, but we are not told how many pieces each customer bought. However, even if we assume each customer bought just one piece, that means 22 total fruits were sold. To find out how many extra pieces the vendor had, we subtract the total sold from the total brought: 75 - 22 = 53. Therefore, the vendor has 53 extra pieces of fruit.\nTherefore, the answer is (53)\n\nQuestion:  The school cafeteria ordered 33 red apples and 23 green apples for students lunches.

Yet, if only 10 customers came in, how many extra products did the store have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe grocery store ordered 100 loaves of bread and 50 bags of chips, totaling 150 products. If only 10 customers came in, we need to consider how many products each customer might typically buy. However, the question does not specify how many products were purchased by the customers. Without this information, we cannot determine how many extra products are left. If we assume that customers bought no products at all, then the store would have 150 products left. But since the problem states 'how many extra products the store had,' we conclude that they had all 150 products left, and those can be considered as extra. Thus, we consider all ordered products to be excess for the weekend sale since they did not sell. Therefore, the store has 150 extra products.\nTherefore, the answer is (150)\n\nQ: The ice cream shop made 100 cones and 50 sundaes for a festival.

This gives a total of 25 + 30 = 55 apples picked. Out of these, only 40 apples were ripe. Since all apples gathered are either ripe or unripe, the number of unripe apples can be calculated by subtracting the number of ripe apples from the total number of apples picked: 55 (total apples) - 40 (ripe apples) = 15 (unripe apples).\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: The supermarket ordered 20 loaves of bread and 50 packets of cheese for the event. But, if only 60 people showed up, how many extra items did the supermarket end with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe supermarket ordered 20 loaves of bread and 50 packets of cheese for the event. Since only 60 people showed up, we need to determine how many items were actually needed. Assuming each person would likely take one loaf of bread and one packet of cheese, a total of 60 items (60 loaves or cheese packets) would be needed if all people took one of each. However, the supermarket only ordered 20 loaves of bread and 50 packets of cheese, which totals 70 items. Since 60 people showed up, the supermarket will have 10 extra items (70 ordered - 60 used = 10 extra). These 10 extra items consist of 10 packets of cheese, as they ordered more cheese items than necessary, and will run out of bread first. Therefore, the supermarket ends up with extra items.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: The grocery store ordered 80 loaves of bread and 30 bags of chips for a promotion. However, if only 50 customers bought items, how many extra did the store have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe grocery store ordered a total of 80 loaves of bread and 30 bags of chips, making the total ordered items 80 + 30 = 110. If only 50 customers bought items, it implies that 50 items were sold. To find out how many items are left, we subtract the number of items sold from the total items ordered: 110 - 50 = 60. Therefore, the store has 60 extra items left after the promotion.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQ: The fruit vendor brought in 40 oranges and 35 bananas for the local market. However, if only 22 customers bought fruit, how many extra pieces did the vendor have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of fruits the vendor brought to the market. The vendor brought in 40 oranges and 35 bananas, which totals to 40 + 35 = 75 fruits. Next, we need to determine how many fruits were sold to the customers. Since there are 22 customers and assuming each customer buys one piece of fruit, that means 22 fruits were sold. Now, we can find out how many pieces of fruit are left by subtracting the number sold from the total brought. So, 75 fruits - 22 fruits sold = 53 fruits remaining. Thus, the vendor has 53 extra pieces of fruit at the end.\nTherefore, the answer is (53)\n\nQuestion:  The school cafeteria ordered 8 red apples and 43 green apples for students lunches.

But, if only 60 people showed up, how many extra items did the supermarket end with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe supermarket ordered 20 loaves of bread and 50 packets of cheese, totaling 70 items. Since 60 people showed up, we assume each person was supposed to receive one item. With 60 items distributed to 60 people, the supermarket has 70 - 60 = 10 items remaining.

With only 10 customers coming in, we need to consider how many products would be bought. Assuming each customer buys at least one product, the maximum number of products sold would be 10. Therefore, we calculate the extra products by subtracting the number of products sold from the total products ordered: 150 total products - 10 products sold = 140 extra products.\nTherefore, the answer is (140)\n\nQ: The movie theater purchased 100 bags of popcorn and 75 sodas for a premiere.

However, only 80 moviegoers came. To find the number of extra snacks, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of snacks and the number of moviegoers: 175 - 80 = 95.

Sarah has 39 pieces, and her schoolmate has 41 pieces. To get the total, we add these two amounts together: 39 + 41 = 80 pieces of candy. Then, they snacked on 2 pieces the first night. To find out how many pieces they have left, we subtract the 2 pieces they snacked on from the total candy: 80 - 2 = 78 pieces. Therefore, after snacking, they have 78 pieces left.\nTherefore, the answer is (78)\n\nQ: The grocery store ordered 80 loaves of bread and 30 bags of chips for a promotion. However, if only 50 customers bought items, how many extra did the store have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe grocery store ordered 80 loaves of bread and 30 bags of chips. If 50 customers bought items, we need to determine how many items were purchased. Assuming each customer bought one loaf of bread and/or one bag of chips, the maximum number of items purchased would be 50. This means that all 50 items were from the stock of 80 loaves of bread and 30 bags of chips. As long as the total number of items purchased is less than the total ordered, we need to calculate how many items are left after 50 purchases. Since 80 + 30 = 110 items in total, and 50 customers purchased items, the remaining stock would be 110 - 50 = 60 items. Thus, the store has 60 items left over from its order. Therefore, the answer is (60).\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQ: The fruit vendor brought in 40 oranges and 35 bananas for the local market. However, if only 22 customers bought fruit, how many extra pieces did the vendor have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of fruits the vendor brought. The vendor has 40 oranges and 35 bananas, which totals 40 + 35 = 75 pieces of fruit. Next, we determine how many pieces of fruit were bought by the customers. If 22 customers bought fruit, we need to assess how many pieces of fruit they could have potentially bought. However, the problem does not specify how many fruits each customer bought. Therefore, if each of the 22 customers bought at least one piece of fruit, then at least 22 pieces were sold, leaving the vendor with 75 - 22 = 53 pieces remaining. If all 22 customers bought a different piece or less than their total combined amount, there could still be 75 - 22 = 53 remaining. In the worst-case scenario of every customer buying only one fruit, the vendor still has extra fruits after the sales. Hence there would certainly be extra pieces left, confirming the answer is non-zero. Since the context does not limit how many pieces each customer could buy, we conclude that the vendor has extras, the minimum being 53 extra pieces. However, since the question asks for how many additional pieces he has irrespective of the sales, we can determine he has 53.\nTherefore, the answer is (53)\n\nQuestion:  The school cafeteria ordered 37 red apples and 45 green apples for students lunches.

If only 30 of them were invited to the next round, how many students did not make it?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of students auditioning for the school play, which includes 50 girls and 6 boys. This gives us a total of 50 + 6 = 56 students. Next, we see that 30 of these students were invited to the next round. To find out how many students did not make it to the next round, we need to subtract the number of students who were invited (30) from the total number of students (56). Thus, 56 - 30 = 26. Therefore, 26 students did not make it to the next round.\nTherefore, the answer is (26)\n\nQ: There were 40 girls and 5 boys applying for the school's debate team. If only 20 of them were called for interviews, how many students did not pass the first stage?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere were a total of 40 girls and 5 boys applying for the debate team, making a total of 45 students. If only 20 of them were called for interviews, we need to determine how many did not pass the first stage.

After some time, 12 more customers joined. If 10 of the meals did not receive a tip, how many meals did receive a tip?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the server was responsible for 32 meals. Then, 12 more customers joined, but their impact on meal count is unclear since we don't have a direct meal count associated with them. However, the question mentions that out of these meals, 10 did not receive a tip. Therefore, to find the number of meals that received a tip, we can subtract the meals that did not receive a tip from the total meals that are assumed to be served. Since typically, unless stated otherwise, it's reasonable to assume that all meals were served from the 32, we compute it as follows: Total meals = 32, Meals without tips = 10. Meals that received tips = Total meals - Meals without tips = 32 - 10 = 22 meals received a tip. However, it is worth noting that the statement to conclude that none received a tip is incorrect given the context. Thus, the correct way to look at it reflects that there were indeed meals that received tips.\nTherefore, the answer is (22)\n\nQ: A barista at 'The Steaming Cup' had 36 customers.

If she finished 40 of them during study time, how many projects did she still need to complete for homework?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSophia received a total of 36 history essays and 24 geography projects. To find out how many projects she still needs to complete, we first need to calculate the total number of assignments she received, which is 36 (essays) + 24 (projects) = 60 assignments. She finished 40 assignments during study time, so we can find out how many assignments she has left by subtracting the finished ones from the total: 60 (total) - 40 (finished) = 20 assignments remaining. Since all remaining assignments can be either history essays or geography projects, and no breakdown of finished projects versus essays is given, we cannot determine how many of each type remain. The question specifically asks about projects. However, since no specific information leads us to assume projects were finished over essays, we will state that she still has 20 assignments remaining with no indication that they all belong to a specific type. Therefore, it cannot accurately be said that there are 'none' if the total is 20.\nTherefore, the answer is (20)\n\nQ: Lisa bought four activity books. One had 20 puzzles, another had 35, and the last two had 10 each. After two weeks, she completed 50 puzzles.

Emma has 25 regular towels and 30 bath towels, which gives us a total of 25 + 30 = 55 towels. Next, we note that Emma managed to wash 15 towels. To find out how many towels she did not wash, we subtract the number of towels she washed from the total number of towels. Thus, 55 - 15 = 40 towels remain unwashed. Therefore, the number of towels Emma did not wash is 40.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: After attending a concert, Maria bought 5 band t-shirts and collected 4 posters.

First, we need to calculate the total number of shirts she had before donating any. This is done by adding the number of blue shirts and red shirts together: 30 + 50 = 80 shirts. Next, Sofia donated 40 shirts. To find out how many shirts she has left, we subtract the donated shirts from the total number of shirts she had: 80 - 40 = 40 shirts. Thus, Sofia has 40 shirts left after her donation.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: Ava collected six comic books. One had 22 strips, another had 18, and the last four had 30 each. After a week she finished 85 strips. How many strips does she still need to finish?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of comic strips Ava collected from all her comic books. She has one comic book with 22 strips, one with 18 strips, and four comic books with 30 strips each. We start by adding the strips from each book: 22 + 18 + (4 * 30). This can be calculated as follows: 4 * 30 = 120. Now, adding this to the other two books: 22 + 18 + 120 = 160. So, Ava collected a total of 160 strips. She finished 85 strips in one week. To find out how many strips she still needs to finish, we subtract the number of strips she has completed from the total number of strips: 160 - 85 = 75. Therefore, Ava still needs to finish 75 strips.\nTherefore, the answer is (75)\n\nQ: Sofia wanted to improve her craft supplies.

First, we add these two amounts together: 25 + 10 = 35 total items. Then, we account for the unusable items. She had 8 unusable items, so we subtract those from the total: 35 - 8 = 27 good items left.\nTherefore, the answer is (27)\n\nQ: Sara needed to clean 15 pairs of socks and 30 towels before the guests arrived. If she had only cleaned 20 of them by the time they got there, how many did she not clean?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSara needed to clean a total of 15 pairs of socks and 30 towels. First, we calculate the total number of items that needed cleaning: 15 + 30 = 45 items. By the time the guests arrived, she had cleaned 20 items. To find out how many items were not cleaned, we subtract the number of cleaned items from the total number of items: 45 - 20 = 25 items. Therefore, the number of items Sara did not clean is 25.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: Emily was responsible for folding 10 blankets and 18 bath towels before the guests came over.

Adding these together gives us the total number of items she was supposed to fold: 10 + 18 = 28. By the time the guests arrived, Emily had only folded 15 items. To find out how many items she did not fold, we subtract the number of items she folded from the total number of items: 28 - 15 = 13. Therefore, the number of items that she did not fold is 13.\nTherefore, the answer is (13)\n\nQuestion:  While shopping, Maria bought 40 green towels and 44 white towels.

After a week she finished 85 strips. How many strips does she still need to finish?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find the total number of strips in all six comic books. There is one comic book with 22 strips, one with 18 strips, and four comic books with 30 strips each. Therefore, we can calculate the total as follows: 22 + 18 + (4 * 30). This simplifies to 22 + 18 + 120, which equals 160. Now that we know Ava has a total of 160 strips to finish, we can subtract the number of strips she has already finished, which is 85. Thus, 160 - 85 equals 75. Therefore, the number of strips she still needs to finish is 75.\nTherefore, the answer is (75)\n\nQ: Emma has 20 reading tasks and 10 writing assignments due. If she completed 15 of the tasks in her study group, how many assignments must she still finish for homework?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmma has a total of 20 reading tasks. She has completed 15 of these tasks in her study group. To find out how many reading tasks she has left to finish for homework, we subtract the number of tasks she completed from the total number of tasks: 20 total tasks - 15 completed tasks = 5 tasks remaining. Emma also has 10 writing assignments due. Since the question asks for the total number of assignments that she still needs to finish for homework, we add the remaining reading tasks to the writing assignments: 5 remaining reading tasks + 10 writing assignments = 15 total assignments that need to be completed.

', 'idx': 107, 'prompt': "Q: Laura wanted to grow her book library. She received 15 books from her cousin and found 10 more at a thrift store. If 5 of the books were damaged, how many intact books did she have in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLaura received 15 books from her cousin and found 10 more at a thrift store. First, we calculate the total number of books she has by adding these two amounts together: 15 + 10 = 25. Next, we are informed that 5 of these books are damaged, so we need to subtract the damaged books from the total number of books: 25 - 5 = 20. Therefore, Laura has a total of 20 intact books.\nTherefore, the answer is (20)\n\nQ: During the citywide book exchange, Tim gathered 22 cookbooks and 8 craft books. If 6 of the books were used, how many new books did he add to his collection?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTim gathered a total of 22 cookbooks and 8 craft books. This totals to 22 + 8 = 30 books. Out of these, 6 books were used, which means they were not new additions to his collection. Therefore, the number of new books Tim added to his collection is 30 - 6 = 24. However, since the question asks how many new books he added and does not specify whether the used books were new or old, we conclude that none of the used books contributed to new additions. Therefore, despite having collected 30 books, accounting for the 6 used ones leads to the understanding that no new books were added to the existing collection.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: Sara purchased 3 books from a store and 1 more from a library. If 2 of the books were damaged, how many usable books did she have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSara initially purchased 3 books from a store and added 1 more from a library. This results in a total of 3 + 1 = 4 books. Two of these books were damaged, so to find the number of usable books, we subtract the damaged books from the total: 4 - 2 = 2. Therefore, Sara has 2 usable books left.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQ: Sarah was looking to enhance her book library. She received 15 books as a gift and purchased 10 more from a bookstore. If 5 of the books were damaged, how many undamaged books did she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of books Sarah had after receiving the gifts and making purchases. She received 15 books and purchased 10 more, so: 15 + 10 = 25 books in total. Next, we account for the damaged books. If 5 of the books are damaged, we subtract those from the total: 25 - 5 = 20 undamaged books. Thus, Sarah has a total of 20 undamaged books.\nTherefore, the answer is (20)\n\nQ: At the charity book event, Liam chose 40 history books and 35 biography books. If 15 of the books were not in mint condition, how many new ones did he acquire?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLiam chose a total of 40 history books and 35 biography books. This gives us a total of 40 + 35 = 75 books. If 15 of these books were not in mint condition, that implies that the remaining number of books that are in mint condition is 75 - 15 = 60. Since the question specifically asks how many new ones he acquired, and it states that 15 were not in mint condition but does not provide any indication that these damaged books were new, we assume that these 15 books are not new. Hence, among the remaining 60 books, it is possible that these are both new and used, but since no specific indication of new books is given, we cannot affirm the quantity of new ones. Therefore, the conclusion is that we do not know how many new books he acquired, but based on the phrasing of the question 'how many new ones did he acquire' compared to the total chosen books, we conclude that his acquisition of new books specifically cannot be determined as specified.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: For a garage sale, Anna and her neighbor combined their items. Anna had 50 books while her neighbor had 30. If they sold 40 books that morning, how many books do they have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many books Anna and her neighbor have left after selling some, we first need to determine the total number of books they combined. Anna had 50 books and her neighbor had 30 books. Adding these together: 50 + 30 = 80 books in total. They sold 40 books that morning. To find out how many books they have left, we subtract the number of books sold from the total number of books: 80 - 40 = 40 books remaining.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: Sara found 25 books at an estate sale and later received 10 more from her neighbor. If 15 of those books were damaged, how many usable books did she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSara found a total of 25 books and received 10 more from her neighbor, so first, we calculate the total number of books she has: 25 + 10 = 35 books in total. Next, out of these 35 books, 15 were damaged. To find the number of usable books, we subtract the damaged books from the total number of books: 35 - 15 = 20 usable books. \nTherefore, the answer is (20)\n\nQ: Laura acquired 45 books from a library sale and then found 30 more at a thrift store.

First, we add the two quantities together: 45 + 30 = 75 books. Next, we need to account for the 50 damaged books. To find the number of usable books, we subtract the damaged books from the total number of books: 75 - 50 = 25 usable books.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQuestion:  A book store had 41 books in the bargin bin.

Two of these sketchbooks each had 50 sketches, making a total of 100 sketches from these two sketchbooks. The other two sketchbooks had not been specified in terms of the number of sketches, but since the question implies that these are the only relevant sketchbooks, we consider the total from those two. After 10 days, she finished 25 sketches out of the total 100. Therefore, to find the number of sketches remaining, we subtract the number of finished sketches from the total number of sketches: 100 - 25 = 75. Thus, there are 75 sketches remaining to be sketched.\nTherefore, the answer is (75)\n\nQ: Emma has 20 reading tasks and 10 writing assignments due.

She completed 15 reading tasks in her study group. This means she has 5 reading tasks remaining (20 total - 15 completed = 5 remaining). The writing assignments remain unchanged since the question does not indicate that any have been completed. Thus, she still has 10 writing assignments due. In total, the assignments she must still finish for homework consist of the remaining reading tasks and the writing assignments: 5 reading tasks + 10 writing assignments = 15 assignments total.

During the evening, the waiter served an additional 18 diners, leading to a total of 22 + 18 = 40 guests. Out of the 18 new diners, 18 left without tipping. Therefore, we need to find how many guests decided to tip. Since 18 left without tipping out of the 18 new diners, it implies none of these diners left a tip. There was no mention of the tipping behavior of the initial 22 guests, so we assume none of them tipped as well for this calculation. Hence, the total number of guests who decided to tip is therefore zero.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: During dinner service at 'The Golden Fork', a waiter managed 60 clients.

If only 40 of the apples were ripe, how many unripe apples did they have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of apples collected by Tom and his sister. Tom picked 25 apples and his sister picked 32 apples. Adding these together, we get 25 + 32 = 57 apples. Next, we were told that only 40 of these apples were ripe. Therefore, to find the number of unripe apples, we subtract the number of ripe apples from the total collected. So, 57 - 40 = 17 unripe apples. Thus, there are 17 unripe apples in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (17)\n\nQ: A farmer had 60 apples. If he picked 20 of them and then later harvested 30 more, how many apples would he have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe farmer started with 60 apples.

If she had only folded 15 of them by the time they arrived, how many did she not fold?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmily was responsible for folding a total of 10 blankets and 18 bath towels. First, we will find the total number of items she was supposed to fold. This can be calculated as 10 + 18, which equals 28. Emily managed to fold only 15 of these items before the guests arrived. To find out how many items she did not fold, we subtract the number of items she folded from the total number of items. Therefore, the calculation is 28 - 15. Performing this subtraction, we find that 28 - 15 equals 13. Therefore, the number of items she did not fold is 13.\nTherefore, the answer is (13)\n\nQ: Ryan had to assemble 16 toys and wrap 10 gifts for the charity event.

Alex has 29 pieces of candy and his cousin has 32 pieces. We can add these two numbers together: 29 + 32 = 61. Then, they munched on 4 pieces of candy the first night. We subtract the 4 pieces from the total: 61 - 4 = 57. Therefore, the total amount of candy they have left after munching on 4 pieces is 57.\nTherefore, the answer is (57)\n\nQ: Sam purchased three puzzle sets. One contained 30 pieces, and the other had 50 pieces. After two weeks, he completed 10 puzzles. How many pieces does he still have left to complete?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSam purchased three puzzle sets: one with 30 pieces and another with 50 pieces. Since he completed 10 puzzles, we need to know the total number of pieces in the puzzle sets. Let's assume that he completed some combination of the 30-piece and 50-piece puzzles. The total number of pieces in the 30-piece set is 30 and in the 50-piece set is 50. We don't know the sizes of the third puzzle set as it has not been specified. Without that information, we can only state that he completed some of the puzzles from the sets based on the total number of pieces in each set. However, since he completed 10 puzzles and we did not know how many pieces are in the third set, we can't determine how many are left to complete from it. Consequently, since he completed 10 puzzles, we can conclude that he has none left to complete if we consider that those 10 represent the total number of pieces across the three sets completed. Thus, if he has completed all the puzzles, then there are no pieces left to complete.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: Noah had 16 puzzles. If he gave away 5 of them and then received 3 new puzzles as a gift, how many puzzles would Noah have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nNoah starts with 16 puzzles.

', 'idx': 147, 'prompt': "Q: The fruit vendor brought in 40 oranges and 35 bananas for the local market. However, if only 22 customers bought fruit, how many extra pieces did the vendor have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe vendor brought in 40 oranges and 35 bananas. First, we calculate the total amount of fruit brought in, which is 40 + 35 = 75 pieces of fruit. Since 22 customers bought fruit, we need to understand how many pieces were potentially bought. If we assume each customer bought at least one piece, they could have bought a maximum of 22 pieces of fruit. To find out how many pieces the vendor has left, we subtract the number of pieces potentially sold from the total pieces brought in. Thus, 75 - 22 = 53 pieces of fruit remain.

First, we add these two amounts together to find out how many items he initially had: 15 + 4 = 19 items. After returning home, he gave away 10 items, so we subtract this from the total he initially had: 19 - 10 = 9 items remaining. Therefore, the answer is (9).\nTherefore, the answer is (9)\n\nQ: Sam purchased three puzzle sets. One contained 30 pieces, and the other had 50 pieces. After two weeks, he completed 10 puzzles. How many pieces does he still have left to complete?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSam purchased two puzzle sets: one with 30 pieces and another with 50 pieces. Assuming he completed 10 puzzles, we first need to determine how many pieces he had in total before starting the puzzles. The total number of pieces Sam had is 30 + 50 = 80 pieces. However, since the question states he completed 10 puzzles, we must consider the composition of those puzzles and how many pieces each might have. Without specific details on how many puzzles he completed from each set, we cannot definitively find out how many pieces he has left. However, if we assume that the puzzles completed were only from those two sets, once again, we cannot ascertain how many pieces remain without knowing how many puzzles each set actually consisted of. Therefore, we deduce that the remaining puzzle pieces Sam has left after completing the puzzles is uncertain based on the information provided. Nonetheless, it’s implied that the phrasing 'completed 10 puzzles’ does not indicate unfinished puzzles still remaining since it suggests they were completed, inferring that he has none left to complete. Thus, we conclude that he has none left. \nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: Sara needed to clean 15 pairs of socks and 30 towels before the guests arrived. If she had only cleaned 20 of them by the time they got there, how many did she not clean?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSara needed to clean a total of 15 pairs of socks and 30 towels. Therefore, the total number of items to clean is: 15 + 30 = 45. She managed to clean 20 of them before the guests arrived. To find out how many she did not clean, we can subtract the number she cleaned from the total number of items. So, 45 - 20 = 25. Hence, the number of items she did not clean is 25.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQuestion:  Sam had 10 socks.

To find the total number of novels he purchased, we only need to consider the romance novels since the question specifically mentions that 5 of those were second-hand. Therefore, the number of brand new romance novels is 45 - 5 = 40. The thriller books are not mentioned as second-hand, but regardless, the question only asks for brand new books, which only applies to the romance novels as no second-hand information for thrillers is given. Thus, the total number of brand new books that are definitely brand new is 40 romance novels. Therefore, there are no contradictions in the phrasing, leading us back to focusing on the romance novels which were 40 new and the thrillers status being unclear does not affect the outcome.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: A bookstore had 9 fiction books in a sale.

If she gave her neighbor 45 of them, how many desserts did Emily end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmily initially has 60 cupcakes and 24 cookies. To find the total number of desserts she initially had, we add the two quantities: 60 cupcakes + 24 cookies = 84 desserts. She then gave her neighbor 45 desserts. To find out how many desserts Emily has left, we subtract the number she gave away from her total: 84 desserts - 45 desserts = 39 desserts.

If she had only baked 10 of them by the time the gathering started, how many did she not bake?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLucy needed to bake a total of 12 cupcakes and 6 cookies, which adds up to 18 baked goods in total. If she managed to bake only 10 of them before the gathering started, we need to calculate how many she did not bake.

{'question': ' A waiter had 33 customers to wait on. If 31 customers left and he got another 26 customers, how many customers would he have? ', 'idx': 188, 'prompt': "Q: A waitress at 'The Diner' started with 28 clients at her station. During the lunch rush, she got an additional 32 clients. If 32 clients did not leave a tip, how many clients left a tip?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe waitress started with 28 clients at her station. During the lunch rush, she received 32 additional clients. Therefore, the total number of clients she had is 28 + 32 = 60 clients. It is given that 32 clients did not leave a tip. To find out how many clients left a tip, we subtract the number of clients who did not leave a tip from the total number of clients: 60 - 32 = 28 clients left a tip.\nTherefore, the answer is (28)\n\nQ: A bartender at 'The Tipsy Tavern' served 25 customers. During the busy evening shift, he added another 15 customers. If 30 of the customers didn't leave him a tip, how many customers did leave a tip?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find the total number of customers served by the bartender. Initially, he served 25 customers, and then during the busy evening shift, he served an additional 15 customers. So, the total number of customers served is 25 + 15 = 40. Out of these 40 customers, it is given that 30 customers did not leave a tip. To find out how many customers did leave a tip, we subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers. Therefore, the number of customers who left a tip is 40 - 30 = 10.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: A cashier at 'The Sweet Spot' had 50 customers to ring up at the counter. As the line grew longer, she handled another 30 customers. If 30 customers chose not to tip, how many actually left a tip?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe problem states that there were 50 customers initially and an additional 30 customers were handled, totaling 80 customers. However, 30 of these customers chose not to tip. Since those 30 customers did not tip, it indicates that they left no tip. There is no information suggesting that the remaining customers tipped, therefore it implies that the number of customers who actually left a tip is zero.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: At the restaurant, there were 28 customers waiting for a table. If 9 customers decided to leave and 2 more were added to the waiting list, how many customers would be left waiting?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 28 customers waiting. When 9 customers left, the number of customers remaining is 28 - 9 = 19. Then, 2 more customers were added to the waiting list, which increases the number of customers waiting: 19 + 2 = 21. Therefore, the total number of customers left waiting is 21.\nTherefore, the answer is (21)\n\nQ: At the bank, 18 customers were waiting for service. If 6 of them left because they were in a rush, and 5 new customers lined up, how many people would remain in line?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 18 customers in line. If 6 customers left because they were in a rush, we subtract 6 from 18, which gives us 12 customers remaining. Then, 5 new customers lined up, so we add 5 to the remaining 12, resulting in a total of 17 customers in line.\nTherefore, the answer is (17)\n\nQ: A waiter at 'The Cozy Cafe' started his shift with 22 guests. During the evening rush, he served another 18 diners. If 18 of them left without tipping, how many guests decided to tip?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the waiter had 22 guests. During the evening rush, he served an additional 18 diners. To find the total number of guests served, we add these two amounts: 22 + 18 = 40. Out of the new 18 diners, it was mentioned that 18 of them left without tipping. Since all 18 of those diners didn't tip, we need to determine how many guests actually tipped. We know that there were 40 total guests but if 18 diners did not tip, we can infer that the remaining guests (22 from the start plus any who did tip from the 18 new diners) are the ones who did tip. So if 18 diners out of the 40 did not tip, that would mean 22 guests could still have tipped. But from the context, we need to consider only guests who might have tipped out of these 18 new guests, suggesting that none tipped since all of them left without tipping. We conclude that no guests decided to tip.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: A server at 'The Hungry Hound' took care of 35 diners during dinner time. When the restaurant got busier, he added 25 more customers. If 25 diners didn't leave a tip, how many diners did leave a tip?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 35 diners. Then, 25 more diners were added, making the total number of diners 35 + 25 = 60. However, 25 diners did not leave a tip.

After eating 20 pieces and then collecting 35 more from the market, how many pieces of fruit does he have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nJack starts with 50 pieces of fruit. After eating 20 pieces, we subtract 20 from 50, which gives us 30 pieces of fruit remaining. Then, he collects 35 more pieces from the market, so we add 35 to the 30 remaining pieces. This gives us a total of 30 + 35 = 65 pieces of fruit. Therefore, Jack now has 65 pieces of fruit in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (65)\n\nQ: The fruit stand had 12 oranges. If they sold 4 to passersby and then purchased 25 more, how many oranges would they have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the fruit stand has 12 oranges. After selling 4 oranges to passersby, the number of oranges left is 12 - 4 = 8 oranges. Then, they purchased 25 more oranges. So, the total number of oranges after the purchase is 8 + 25 = 33 oranges.\nTherefore, the answer is (33)\n\nQ: The fruit vendor brought in 40 oranges and 35 bananas for the local market. However, if only 22 customers bought fruit, how many extra pieces did the vendor have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe fruit vendor brought in a total of 40 oranges and 35 bananas. First, we calculate the total number of fruits brought in by adding the number of oranges to the number of bananas: 40 + 35 = 75. Next, we know that only 22 customers bought fruit, but we do not know how many fruits each customer bought. To find the excess fruit, we will assume the worst-case scenario where each customer bought one piece of fruit, leading to a total of 22 fruits sold. We then subtract the number of fruits sold from the total number of fruits brought in: 75 - 22 = 53. Thus, the vendor has 53 extra pieces of fruit.\nTherefore, the answer is (53)\n\nQuestion:  A store had 40 oranges in a bin.

He traded in 12 games with friends and acquired 6 new ones from a sale. If 4 of the games were scratched, how many playable games remained?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMike started with 12 games and traded them in for 6 new ones. We first need to calculate how many games he has now. He traded in 12 games and then got 6 new ones, so he has 6 - 12 = -6. This means he doesn't have any extra games right now because he traded in more than he acquired. Next, we consider the condition of the games: out of the total games, it is mentioned that 4 were scratched. Since he has -6 games, and we can't have a negative number of playable games, it means he ends up with 0 playable games. Therefore, the final count of playable games is 0.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: In the ticket line for the movie, there were 25 people.

She downloaded 8 games and bought 12 more at a convention. Adding these gives us 8 + 12 = 20 games in total. Next, we need to subtract the corrupted games. Since 4 games were corrupted, we subtract 4 from 20, resulting in 20 - 4 = 16 playable games. Therefore, Jenny ended up with 16 playable games.\nTherefore, the answer is (16)\n\nQ: There were 5 friends watching a movie when 3 more friends came to join.

', 'idx': 211, 'prompt': "Q: A pet shop had 24 puppies in the kennel. If they adopted out 10 of the old ones and brought in 5 new ones, how many would be in the kennel?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe pet shop starts with 24 puppies in the kennel. They adopt out 10 of the old puppies, which reduces the number of puppies to 24 - 10 = 14. Then, they bring in 5 new puppies, which increases the number to 14 + 5 = 19. Therefore, the total number of puppies in the kennel after these transactions is 19.\nTherefore, the answer is (19)\n\nQ: The pet shop brought in 14 puppies and 30 kittens for adoption day. But, if only 35 people came by, how many extra animals did the shop have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the number of extra animals the shop had, we first calculate the total number of animals brought in for adoption. There were 14 puppies and 30 kittens, so: 14 + 30 = 44 animals in total. Next, we look at the number of people who came to adopt. Since only 35 people showed up and theoretically, we could assume each person adopts one animal, we have: 35 animals potentially adopted. To find the number of extra animals, we subtract the number of people from the total number of animals: 44 total animals - 35 people = 9 extra animals. Therefore, the answer is (9).\nTherefore, the answer is (9)\n\nQ: A pet shop had 4 fish in an aquarium. If they sold 1 of the old ones and added 22 new ones, how many would be in the aquarium?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there are 4 fish in the aquarium. They sold 1 of the old fish, which leaves them with 3 fish (4 - 1 = 3). Then they added 22 new fish to the tank, which increases the total number of fish to 25 (3 + 22 = 25).\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: The pet store had 22 fish. If they sold 3 to customers and then received 10 more from a supplier, how many fish would they have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nStart with the initial number of fish in the store, which is 22. After selling 3 fish to customers, subtract 3 from 22, resulting in 19 fish remaining. Then, the store receives 10 more fish from a supplier. Add these 10 fish to the 19 remaining fish, resulting in a total of 29 fish in the store.\nTherefore, the answer is (29)\n\nQ: A pet shop had 50 puppies available. If they sold 12 of the older puppies and brought in 8 new ones, how many puppies would be available?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nStart with the initial number of puppies available at the pet shop, which is 50. Then, subtract the number of older puppies sold, which is 12. This gives us 50 - 12 = 38. Next, add the 8 new puppies that were brought in. So, we have 38 + 8 = 46. Therefore, the total number of puppies available at the pet shop is 46.\nTherefore, the answer is (46)\n\nQ: A pet store had 30 puppies in the adoption area. If they adopted out 12 puppies, but then brought in 5 more, how many puppies would be in the area?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 30 puppies in the adoption area. After adopting out 12 puppies, the number of puppies left is 30 - 12 = 18. Then, the store brings in 5 more puppies, so the total number of puppies in the area becomes 18 + 5 = 23.\nTherefore, the answer is (23)\n\nQ: A pet shop had 10 puppies available. If they sold 3 puppies, but then brought in 8 more, how many puppies would be available?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the pet shop has 10 puppies.

Then, the shop brings in 8 more puppies, which increases the total to 7 + 8 = 15 puppies available.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: There are 4 rabbit pens in a petting zoo. If each pen contains 3 rabbits and 2 guinea pigs, what is the total number of animals in the zoo?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of animals in the zoo, we start by calculating the number of animals in one pen. Each pen contains 3 rabbits and 2 guinea pigs, which can be added together. So, in one pen, there are 3 + 2 = 5 animals. Since there are 4 pens in total, we can multiply the number of animals in one pen by the number of pens: 5 animals/pen * 4 pens = 20 animals overall. Therefore, the total number of animals in the zoo is (20).\nTherefore, the answer is (20)\n\nQuestion:  A pet store has 9 bird cages.

If she answered 5 questions correctly in the first round and 6 in the second, what will her score be?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate Sophie’s total score in the trivia quiz, first, we need to determine her score from each round. In the first round, she answered 5 questions correctly, earning 4 points for each correct answer. Thus, her score for the first round is calculated as: 5 correct answers * 4 points each = 20 points. In the second round, she answered 6 questions correctly, so her score for this round is: 6 correct answers * 4 points each = 24 points. Now, we can find her total score by adding the scores from both rounds: 20 points (first round) + 24 points (second round) = 44 points.

On the first day, he found 3 clues, and on the second day, he found 2 clues. First, we need to calculate the points earned from the clues found on both days. For the first day: 3 clues * 7 points per clue = 21 points. For the second day: 2 clues * 7 points per clue = 14 points. Now, we sum the points from both days: 21 points + 14 points = 35 points. Therefore, the total score is 35.\nTherefore, the answer is (35)\n\nQuestion:  Faye was playing a video game where she scores 7 points for each treasure she finds.

But, if only 35 people came by, how many extra animals did the shop have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine the total number of animals brought in by the pet shop. There are 14 puppies and 30 kittens. Adding these together gives us 14 + 30 = 44 animals. Next, we look at the number of people who came by for adoption, which is 35. If each of these people takes one animal, then they would adopt a total of 35 animals. To find out how many extra animals the shop has, we subtract the number of adopted animals (35) from the total number of animals (44): 44 - 35 = 9. Therefore, the shop has 9 extra animals after the adoption day.\nTherefore, the answer is (9)\n\nQ: A pet shop had 24 puppies in the kennel. If they adopted out 10 of the old ones and brought in 5 new ones, how many would be in the kennel?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there are 24 puppies in the kennel.

If each enclosure contains 3 lions and 4 tigers, how many animals are there in total at the zoo?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of lions and tigers in one enclosure. Each enclosure contains 3 lions and 4 tigers. Therefore, one enclosure has a total of 3 + 4 = 7 animals. Since there are 5 animal enclosures, we multiply the number of animals in one enclosure by the number of enclosures: 7 animals/enclosure * 5 enclosures = 35 animals in total. Thus, the total number of animals at the zoo is 35.\nTherefore, the answer is (35)\n\nQ: A pet shop had 50 puppies available. If they sold 12 of the older puppies and brought in 8 new ones, how many puppies would be available?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe pet shop initially has 50 puppies.

But, if only 35 people came by, how many extra animals did the shop have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of animals brought in by the pet shop. There are 14 puppies and 30 kittens, so the total number of animals is 14 + 30 = 44 animals. Next, we note that only 35 people came for adoption. Assuming that each person adopts one animal, the total number of animals adopted would be 35. To find out how many extra animals the shop had, we subtract the number of animals adopted from the total number of animals. This gives us 44 - 35 = 9 extra animals.

Carlos bought 9 tickets for himself and his friends plus 4 extra tickets for anyone who wanted to attend. This means Carlos purchased a total of 9 + 4 = 13 tickets. Each ticket costs 7 dollars, so we multiply the total number of tickets by the cost of each ticket: 13 tickets * 7 dollars/ticket = 91 dollars. Therefore, the total amount spent by Carlos is 91 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (91)\n\nQ: Emma was arranging her collection of CDs, ensuring that each of the boxes had exactly 10 CDs in them.

Each shelf has exactly 9 albums. Ava has 3 shelves of rock albums and 2 shelves of pop albums. First, we calculate the total rock albums: 3 shelves * 9 albums/shelf = 27 rock albums. Next, we calculate the total pop albums: 2 shelves * 9 albums/shelf = 18 pop albums. Finally, we add the total rock and pop albums together: 27 rock albums + 18 pop albums = 45 albums in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (45)\n\nQ: Laura sought to improve her music album collection. She bought 25 CDs from a friend and added 4 more during a sale.

Since Lisa can read 5 pages in 15 minutes, we can find out how many sets of 5 pages are in the 50 pages she needs to read. This is calculated by dividing the total pages by 5, which is 50 / 5 = 10 sets. Since each set takes 15 minutes, we multiply the number of sets by the time per set: 10 sets * 15 minutes/set = 150 minutes. Finally, we conclude that the total time it takes Lisa to finish reading everything is 150 minutes.\nTherefore, the answer is (150)\n\nQ: Sofia was assigned 50 geography exercises and 15 art projects.

{'question': ' A pet shelter had 9 puppies when another 12 were brought in. If 3 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted? ', 'idx': 313, 'prompt': "Q: A rescue organization had 12 guinea pigs when another 9 were brought in. If 3 guinea pigs a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of guinea pigs after the additional 9 were brought in. Initially, there were 12 guinea pigs. Adding 9 gives us a total of 12 + 9 = 21 guinea pigs. Next, we know that 3 guinea pigs are adopted per day. To find out how many days it will take for all 21 guinea pigs to be adopted, we divide the total number of guinea pigs by the number adopted per day. Thus, 21 guinea pigs / 3 guinea pigs per day = 7 days. Therefore, it will take 7 days for all the guinea pigs to be adopted.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: A cat rescue had 7 kittens when another 15 were rescued. If 4 kittens a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of kittens. The cat rescue initially had 7 kittens and rescued another 15. Therefore, the total number of kittens is 7 + 15 = 22 kittens. Next, we know that 4 kittens are adopted each day. To find out how long it will take for all 22 kittens to be adopted, we divide the total number of kittens by the number of kittens adopted per day: 22 kittens / 4 kittens per day = 5.5 days. Since the number of days must be a whole number, we consider that it would take 5 days to adopt 20 kittens, and on the 6th day, the last 2 kittens would be adopted. Therefore, the answer in whole days is 6.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: A bird sanctuary had 10 parrots when 20 more were added.

She needs to collect 15 books from one shelf and 3 books from another shelf. Adding these together gives us a total of 15 + 3 = 18 books. Since Sara can carry 6 books at a time, we determine how many trips she needs to make by dividing the total number of books by the number of books she can carry per trip. Therefore, 18 books ÷ 6 books per trip = 3 trips. Since this division results in a whole number, it indicates that she can make these trips without needing any additional trips.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: Kevin was helping to sort out recycling bins, but he could only carry 4 bins at a time.

Next, since Nancy can carry 10 chairs at a time, we will determine how many trips she needs to make. We divide the total number of chairs by the number of chairs she can carry in one trip: 36 / 10 = 3.6. Since she cannot make a partial trip, we round this number up to the next whole number, which is 4. Therefore, Nancy will make 4 trips to pick up all the chairs.\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQ: Emily was assisting the construction crew with moving bricks, but she could only carry 8 bricks at a time.

First, we find out how many bricks she needs to move in total. She needs to pick up 25 bricks from one pile and 7 from another pile. So, we add these two numbers together: 25 + 7 = 32 bricks total. Next, we determine how many trips she needs to make to carry all 32 bricks. We divide the total number of bricks by the number she can carry at once: 32 bricks ÷ 8 bricks per trip = 4 trips. Therefore, Emily will make 4 trips to move all the bricks.\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQ: Jake was helping his coach gather soccer cones, but he could only carry 5 cones at a time. If he had to pick up 12 cones from one side of the field and 4 cones from the other side, how many trips will he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nJake needs to collect a total of 12 cones from one side of the field and 4 cones from the other side. First, we sum the total number of cones: 12 + 4 = 16 cones. Since Jake can carry only 5 cones at a time, we determine how many trips he needs to make. To find the number of trips, we divide the total number of cones by the number he can carry in one trip: 16 cones ÷ 5 cones/trip = 3.2 trips. Since Jake cannot make a fraction of a trip, he needs to round up to the nearest whole number. Thus, he will need to make 4 trips in total to collect all the cones.\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQ: Tom was helping the grocery staff stock shelves, but he could only carry 4 bags at a time.

If 6 rabbits find homes each day, how many days will it take for all to be adopted?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of rabbits in the sanctuary. They started with 30 rabbits and rescued 45 more, so we add these two amounts together: 30 + 45 = 75. Next, we know that 6 rabbits find homes each day. To find out how many days it will take for all 75 rabbits to be adopted, we divide the total number of rabbits by the number of rabbits adopted per day: 75 / 6 = 12.5. Since we cannot have a fraction of a day in this context, we round up to the next whole number because it will take a full additional day to adopt the remaining rabbits. Therefore, it will take a total of 13 days for all the rabbits to be adopted.\nTherefore, the answer is (13)\n\nQ: A pet store had 8 hamsters when another 6 were received. If 2 hamsters a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe pet store initially has 8 hamsters and receives an additional 6 hamsters. Therefore, the total number of hamsters is 8 + 6 = 14 hamsters. If 2 hamsters are adopted each day, we need to determine how many days it will take to adopt all 14 hamsters. To find this, we divide the total number of hamsters by the number of hamsters adopted per day: 14 / 2 = 7 days. Thus, it will take 7 days for all hamsters to be adopted.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: A cat rescue had 7 kittens when another 15 were rescued. If 4 kittens a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of kittens. We started with 7 kittens and then rescued an additional 15 kittens. So, the total number of kittens is 7 + 15 = 22 kittens. Next, we need to figure out how many days it would take to adopt out all 22 kittens if 4 kittens are adopted each day. We can find this by dividing the total number of kittens by the number of kittens adopted each day: 22 kittens / 4 kittens per day = 5.5 days. Since we cannot have half a day in terms of adopting kittens, we round this up to the nearest whole number, which is 6 days. Therefore, it will take a total of 6 days to adopt all the kittens.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: A dog rescue center had 15 dogs when they took in another 50. If 5 dogs get adopted each day, how many days will it take for all of them to be adopted?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we start with the initial number of dogs at the rescue center, which is 15. They then take in 50 more dogs. To find the total number of dogs, we add the two amounts: 15 + 50 = 65 dogs. Next, we need to determine how many days it will take for all 65 dogs to be adopted if 5 dogs are adopted each day. We can find this by dividing the total number of dogs by the number of dogs adopted per day: 65 / 5 = 13 days. Hence, it will take 13 days for all of the dogs to be adopted.\nTherefore, the answer is (13)\n\nQuestion:  A pet shelter had 17 puppies when another 55 were brought in.

We have 8 new members and 7 returning members. Adding these together gives us a total of 8 + 7 = 15 members. Next, we need to determine how many teams can be formed if each team consists of 6 members. To find out how many complete teams we can make, we divide the total number of members by the number of members per team: 15 members ÷ 6 members/team = 2.5 teams. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a team, we take the whole number, which means we can form 2 complete teams with 3 members left over. Since we are only considering complete teams, we conclude that there are 2 full teams.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQ: A team of 3 players went to a café.

Initially, there were 15 sandwiches prepared. Additionally, the staff made 9 more sandwiches. So we need to add these two amounts together to find the total number of sandwiches. \n\nTotal sandwiches = 15 (prepared) + 9 (additional) = 24 sandwiches. \n\nNext, we need to distribute these sandwiches equally among the 3 players. To determine how many sandwiches each player would get, we divide the total number of sandwiches by the number of players. \n\nSandwiches per player = Total sandwiches ÷ Number of players = 24 ÷ 3 = 8. \n\nThus, each player would receive 8 sandwiches.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: The community basketball league had 36 newcomers and 12 veterans.

How many shelves did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of boxed sets available. Initially, the bookstore had 12 boxed sets and received an additional 24 boxed sets. So, the total is 12 + 24 = 36 boxed sets. Next, they arranged the boxed sets on shelves, with 8 sets per shelf. To find the number of shelves used, we divide the total number of boxed sets by the number of sets per shelf: 36 ÷ 8 = 4.5. Since they cannot use half a shelf, we take the whole number part of this division to find the number of full shelves used, which is 4. However, since there are remaining boxed sets after filling 4 shelves (4 shelves x 8 sets/shelf = 32 sets), this means there are 4 boxed sets left which would require another shelf. Therefore, they actually used 5 shelves in total to store all the boxed sets.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: A stationery store had 8 packs of markers in stock before they received another shipment of 24 packs.

{'question': ' A pet shelter had 17 puppies when another 55 were brought in. If 8 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted? ', 'idx': 357, 'prompt': "Q: A dog shelter started with 25 dogs before 40 more dogs were taken in. If 10 dogs are adopted every day, how long will it take for all of them to find homes?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the dog shelter has 25 dogs. They then take in 40 more dogs, so the total number of dogs becomes 25 + 40 = 65 dogs. If 10 dogs are adopted every day, we need to find out how many days it will take for all 65 dogs to be adopted. To find this, we can divide the total number of dogs by the number of dogs adopted per day: 65 dogs ÷ 10 dogs/day = 6.5 days. Since adoption takes place in whole days, we round up to the next whole day, which is 7 days. Therefore, it will take a total of 7 days for all the dogs to find homes.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: A cat rescue had 12 kittens when an additional 30 were rescued. If 4 kittens are adopted each day, how many days will it take for all of them to be adopted?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find the total number of kittens. Initially, the rescue had 12 kittens and then rescued an additional 30 kittens. Therefore, the total number of kittens is 12 + 30 = 42. Next, we know that 4 kittens are adopted each day. To find out how many days it will take to adopt all 42 kittens, we divide the total number of kittens by the number of kittens adopted per day. This can be calculated as 42 kittens / 4 kittens per day = 10.5 days. Since we cannot have a fraction of a day in terms of adoption, we round up to the next whole number, which is 11 days. Thus, it will take a total of 11 days for all kittens to be adopted.\nTherefore, the answer is (11)\n\nQ: A wildlife sanctuary started with 30 rabbits, and then 45 more were rescued. If 6 rabbits find homes each day, how many days will it take for all to be adopted?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of rabbits. The sanctuary started with 30 rabbits and then rescued 45 more. This gives us a total of 30 + 45 = 75 rabbits. Next, we know that 6 rabbits are finding homes each day. To find out how many days it will take to adopt all 75 rabbits, we divide the total number of rabbits by the number of rabbits adopted per day. Thus, the calculation is 75 rabbits / 6 rabbits per day = 12.5 days. Since it is not feasible to have half a day in this context, we round up to the next whole number, which is 13 days. Therefore, it will take 13 days for all rabbits to be adopted.\nTherefore, the answer is (13)\n\nQ: A pet store had 8 hamsters when another 6 were received.

Initially, there are 8 hamsters, and 6 more are received, giving a total of 8 + 6 = 14 hamsters. Next, we need to consider how many days it will take to adopt all these hamsters if 2 are adopted each day. We take the total number of hamsters (14) and divide it by the number of hamsters adopted per day (2): 14 / 2 = 7. Therefore, it will take 7 days for all the hamsters to be adopted.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: A cat rescue had 7 kittens when another 15 were rescued.

Initially, there were 7 kittens, and 15 more were rescued. Therefore, the total number of kittens is 7 + 15 = 22. Next, we are given that 4 kittens are adopted each day. To find out how many days it will take to adopt all 22 kittens, we divide the total number of kittens by the number of kittens adopted per day: 22 / 4 = 5.5. Since we cannot have half a day for adoption, it would take 6 days to ensure all kittens are adopted.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: A rescue organization had 12 guinea pigs when another 9 were brought in.

Then, they received an additional 9 guinea pigs. Thus, the total number of guinea pigs is 12 + 9 = 21. If 3 guinea pigs are adopted each day, we can calculate the number of days required to adopt all 21 guinea pigs. We will divide the total number of guinea pigs by the number of guinea pigs adopted per day: 21 ÷ 3 = 7. Therefore, it will take 7 days for all of the guinea pigs to be adopted.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: A pet adoption center had 15 birds when 8 more were rescued.

Since they earn one point for every 4 pounds collected, we divide her total pounds collected by 4. Therefore, Rachel's points = 24 pounds / 4 pounds per point = 6 points. Next, we calculate the points earned by her team for collecting 16 pounds. Using the same method, Team's points = 16 pounds / 4 pounds per point = 4 points. To find the total points earned, we add Rachel's points and her team's points together: 6 points + 4 points = 10 points. Therefore, the total points earned by Rachel and her team is 10.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Emily and her friends were collecting aluminum foil for recycling. For every 6 pounds they collected, they earned one point. If Emily collected 12 pounds and her friends collected 18 pounds, how many points did they earn?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out the total weight of aluminum foil collected by Emily and her friends. Emily collected 12 pounds, and her friends collected 18 pounds. Therefore, the total amount collected is 12 + 18 = 30 pounds. Next, we determine how many points they earned based on the recycling incentive. For every 6 pounds collected, they earn 1 point. We divide the total pounds collected (30) by 6 to find the total points. So, 30 pounds ÷ 6 pounds/point = 5 points. Therefore, they earned a total of 5 points.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Samantha and her classmates were salvaging aluminum foil for their fundraiser. For every 2 pounds they salvaged, they earned half a point. If Samantha salvaged 20 pounds and her classmates salvaged 4 pounds, how many points did they earn?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, let's calculate the points earned by Samantha. She salvaged 20 pounds. According to the problem, for every 2 pounds salvaged, they earn half a point. Therefore, for 20 pounds: (20 pounds / 2 pounds) = 10, and 10 * (0.5 points) = 5 points. \n\nNow, let's calculate the points earned by her classmates. They salvaged 4 pounds. Using the same calculation: (4 pounds / 2 pounds) = 2, and 2 * (0.5 points) = 1 point. \n\nNext, we sum the points earned by both Samantha and her classmates: 5 points + 1 point = 6 points. \n\nThus, the total points earned by Samantha and her classmates is 6 points.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: Liam and his classmates were collecting cans for their school project. For every 10 pounds they collected, they earned 2 points. If Liam collected 30 pounds and his classmates collected 20 pounds, how many points did they earn?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLiam collected 30 pounds. Points earned for Liam's collection can be calculated as follows: For every 10 pounds, they earn 2 points. So, for 30 pounds: 30 pounds ÷ 10 = 3. Therefore, Liam earns 3 × 2 points = 6 points. \n\nLiam's classmates collected 20 pounds. Points earned for their collection can be calculated similarly: 20 pounds ÷ 10 = 2. Therefore, the classmates earn 2 × 2 points = 4 points. \n\nTo find the total points earned, add Liam's points and his classmates' points together: 6 points + 4 points = 10 points.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Karen and her group were collecting cans for a recycling competition. For every 6 pounds they collected, they earned one point. If Karen collected 18 pounds and her group collected 12 pounds, how many points did they earn?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine the total pounds of cans collected by Karen and her group. Karen collected 18 pounds and her group collected 12 pounds. To find the total, we add these two amounts together: 18 pounds + 12 pounds = 30 pounds.\n\nNext, we want to find out how many points they earned based on the total weight of cans collected. According to the problem, they earn 1 point for every 6 pounds collected. We calculate the total points by dividing the total pounds by 6: 30 pounds ÷ 6 pounds/point = 5 points.\n\nThus, the total points earned by Karen and her group is 5.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Mike and his friends were recycling newspapers for a class project.

If Mike recycled 25 pounds and his friends recycled 15 pounds, how many points did they earn?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, let's calculate how many pounds Mike recycled and how many points he earned. Mike recycled 25 pounds. Since they earn one point for every 5 pounds recycled, we divide 25 by 5: 25 / 5 = 5 points. Next, we calculate how many pounds Mike's friends recycled, which is 15 pounds. They earn points in the same way, so we divide 15 by 5: 15 / 5 = 3 points. Finally, we add the points earned by Mike and his friends together: 5 points (Mike) + 3 points (friends) = 8 points total. Therefore, they earned a total of 8 points.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQuestion:  Zoe and her friends were recycling paper for their class.

{'question': ' At a restaurant each adult meal costs $3 and kids eat free. If a group of 12 people came in and 7 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat? ', 'idx': 411, 'prompt': "Q: At a food truck, adult meals are priced at $6 and all kids can eat at no cost. If a gathering of 18 guests consists of 6 children, how much will the group have to pay?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the total cost for the group, we first need to identify how many adult meals need to be purchased. The group consists of 18 guests in total, and there are 6 children. Since kids eat for free, we only need to pay for the adult meals. The number of adults is calculated by subtracting the number of children from the total number of guests: 18 - 6 = 12 adults. Each adult meal costs $6, so the total cost is calculated as follows: 12 adults * $6/adult = $72. Thus, the total amount the group has to pay is $72.\nTherefore, the answer is (72)\n\nQ: At a buffet, adult entries are $10 and kids under 12 eat for free. If a group of 20 arrives with 8 kids, how much is the total cost for the adults?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, determine the total number of people in the group, which is given as 20. Out of these, 8 are kids who eat for free. To find the number of adults, subtract the number of kids from the total number of people: 20 - 8 = 12 adults. Each adult entry costs $10. Therefore, the total cost for the adults is calculated by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per adult: 12 adults * $10/adult = $120. \nTherefore, the answer is (120)\n\nQ: At a café, each adult sandwich costs $5 and children eat at a discount. If a party of 15 people arrives and 10 are children, what will be the total cost for the group?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine the number of adults in the party. There are 15 people in total and 10 are children. Thus, the number of adults is 15 - 10 = 5 adults. Each adult sandwich costs $5, so the total cost for the adults is 5 adults * $5/adult = $25. The problem does not provide the cost of children's meals, but since they eat at a discount, we assume the cost is lower or even possibly free, making the total for children's meals effectively $0 or some nominal discount. However, without a specific cost for the children's meals, we cannot calculate an exact total. Therefore, we will only include the cost for adults. Hence, the minimum total cost for the group would be $25 (if children’s meals are free).\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: A couple went to a candy store with their 2 children. The store had 20 lollipops in stock and added 10 more for the family. If they shared them evenly, how many lollipops would each member of the family receive?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of lollipops by adding the initial amount to the amount added to the store. The store had 20 lollipops and then added 10 more, so the total is 20 + 10 = 30 lollipops. Next, we consider the family size. The couple has 2 children, making a total of 4 family members. To find out how many lollipops each family member receives, we divide the total number of lollipops by the number of family members: 30 lollipops ÷ 4 family members = 7.5 lollipops per member. Since we are looking for whole lollipop counts in this context, logically, we would say they cannot evenly share lollipops among 4 members without cutting them. Therefore, the answer isn't an exact whole number, but if they are considered, it reflects that each would approximately get 7.5 lollipops, although practically, they would either take 7 or 8 each, leading to one or two lollipops remaining. This emphasizes the nature of practical sharing versus mathematical distribution. Thus, while mathematically 7.5 is the outcome, the nature of lollipops means we need to understand that they cannot be practically shared evenly. However, since the question asks for a straightforward number we treat it as permissible to divide as above, hence leading to how numbers can be handled in balance rather than accounting for physical items. Hence, people working with candy could round practically in both extremes; however, theoretically, the exact division gives a helpful touch in understanding distributions in social cases. Thus finalized, you could round this to believe they manage towards practical limits with some rounding thresholds. Therefore, the answer reflects a close estimate in practical yet theoretical handling of even accounting with real items sharing in homes.\nTherefore, the answer is (7.5)\n\nQ: At a grill, every adult steak meal is $15 and kids can eat for free. If a gathering of 10 people includes 3 kids, what is the total price for the group to dine?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine the number of adult steak meals. Since there are 10 people in total and 3 of them are kids, the number of adults is 10 - 3 = 7 adults. Each adult steak meal costs $15. Therefore, the total cost for the adult steak meals is 7 adults * $15/adult = $105. Since kids eat for free, there is no additional cost for them. Thus, the total price for the group to dine is solely the cost of the adult meals, which is $105.\nTherefore, the answer is (105)\n\nQ: In a pizzeria, each adult pizza costs $7 while kids under 6 are allowed to eat at no charge. If a crowd of 30 people shows up with 12 kids, what will the bill be?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we identify the total number of people in the pizzeria, which is 30. Out of these, 12 are kids under 6 years old who eat for free. Therefore, the number of adults (or paid pizzas) is calculated by subtracting the number of kids from the total number of people: 30 - 12 = 18 adults. Each adult pizza costs $7, so we multiply the number of adult pizzas by the cost per pizza: 18 * 7 = 126. Thus, the total bill is $126.\nTherefore, the answer is (126)\n\nQ: At John's Diner, a group consisting of 1 adult and 6 children arrived for lunch. If each meal is priced at 4 dollars, how much will the total amount be?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of meals ordered. The group consists of 1 adult and 6 children, which gives us a total of 1 + 6 = 7 meals. Each meal is priced at 4 dollars.

If a family of 8 comes in with 4 children, how much would they need to pay for their meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere is a total of 8 family members, with 4 of them being children. Since kids dine for free, we only need to consider the adults. Therefore, there are 8 - 4 = 4 adults. Each adult breakfast costs $4. To find the total cost for the adults, we multiply the number of adults by the cost per adult: 4 adults x $4/adult = $16. Thus, the total amount the family needs to pay for their meals is $16.\nTherefore, the answer is (16)\n\nQuestion:  At a restaurant each adult meal costs $3 and kids eat free.

After acquiring a new stock of 5 action figures, the total number of action figures became 15 + 5 = 20. The action figures are displayed on racks with each rack holding 4 action figures. To determine the number of racks used, we divide the total number of action figures by the number of action figures per rack: 20 / 4 = 5 racks. Thus, the store used 5 racks for displaying the action figures.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Tom's toy store had a sale where each action figure was 5 dollars. If Jack bought 1 superhero and 2 villain action figures, how much did he spend?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the cost for each type of action figure. The price of each action figure is 5 dollars. Jack bought 1 superhero action figure, which costs 5 dollars, and 2 villain action figures. The cost for 2 villain action figures is calculated by multiplying 2 by 5 dollars, which equals 10 dollars. Now, we add the cost of the superhero action figure to the total cost of the villain action figures: 5 dollars (for the superhero) + 10 dollars (for the villains) equals 15 dollars. Therefore, the total amount Jack spent is 15 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: Tommy has 8 comic books, but needs 22 to have the whole series. If each comic book costs $3, how much money would he require to complete the series?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTommy currently has 8 comic books and needs a total of 22 to complete the series. First, we need to determine how many more comic books he needs by subtracting the number of comic books he has from the total he needs: 22 - 8 = 14. This means he needs 14 more comic books. Next, we know that each comic book costs $3. To find the total amount of money required to buy the additional 14 comic books, we multiply the number of comic books needed by the cost of each comic book: 14 * 3 = 42. Therefore, Tommy requires a total of $42 to complete the series.\nTherefore, the answer is (42)\n\nQ: Lucas was assisting his teacher in gathering art supplies, but he could only carry 5 supplies at a time.

He needs 15 supplies from one shelf and 4 from another shelf, which totals to 15 + 4 = 19 supplies. Since Lucas can carry only 5 supplies at a time, to determine how many trips he needs to make, we divide the total number of supplies by the number he can carry in one trip. This can be calculated as 19 supplies / 5 supplies per trip. The result is 3.8 trips.

Thus, the total points earned is 9 soldiers * 8 points/soldier = 72 points.\nTherefore, the answer is (72)\n\nQ: Lisa was smashing crates in an adventure game where she earns 3 points for each crate she destroys. If she destroyed 8 crates on the first stage and 6 on the second, what would her score be?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the points earned from destroying crates in both stages. Lisa earns 3 points for each crate she destroys. In the first stage, she destroyed 8 crates. Therefore, the points from the first stage are 8 crates * 3 points/crate = 24 points. In the second stage, she destroyed 6 crates, which gives her 6 crates * 3 points/crate = 18 points. To find her total score, we sum the points from both stages: 24 points (first stage) + 18 points (second stage) = 42 points.\nTherefore, the answer is (42)\n\nQ: In a sports match, each goal scored gives you 4 points.

If he wanted to sell the complete games for $12 each, how much money could he earn?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nDavid had a total of 22 board games. However, 6 of these games are missing pieces. To find out how many complete games he has, we subtract the missing games from the total games: 22 - 6 = 16 complete games. If each complete game can be sold for $12, we calculate the total money earned by multiplying the number of complete games by the price per game: 16 * 12 = 192.

He later purchased 15 more games, bringing his total to 80 + 15 = 95 games. Out of these, 70 games were defective. To find the number of working games, we subtract the defective games from the total number of games: 95 - 70 = 25. Therefore, the number of working games Kevin has is 25.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: Mark owns 12 video games, but requires 25 for his full library. If each game costs $15, how much total money would he need to acquire the rest?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMark owns 12 video games and needs 25 to complete his library. First, we determine how many more games he needs by subtracting the number of games he owns from the total he wants: 25 - 12 = 13. Next, each game costs $15. To find the total cost for the 13 additional games, we multiply the number of games needed by the cost per game: 13 * 15 = 195. Therefore, the total money Mark would need to acquire the rest of the games is $195.\nTherefore, the answer is (195)\n\nQ: Mike was interested in boosting his video game library. He traded in 12 games with friends and acquired 6 new ones from a sale. If 4 of the games were scratched, how many playable games remained?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMike started with an unknown number of games. He traded in 12 games and acquired 6 new ones. After the trades, he effectively reduced his total game count by 12 and then increased it by 6. Therefore, the net change in the number of games is -12 + 6 = -6 games. Thus, he has 6 fewer games than he initially had from the trading process. Then, we know that 4 of the total games acquired or retained are scratched. Assuming he is now at 0 games, we need to consider the scratched games. 0 - 4 scratched games leaves him with no playable games. Hence, the number of playable games remaining is 0.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: Michael owned 35 games. If he traded 15 of them and used the trade-in value to purchase 8 new games, how many games would Michael now own?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMichael initially owns 35 games. After trading 15 games, he calculates his remaining games: 35 - 15 = 20 games. Then, he purchases 8 new games using the trade-in value.

If he had 4 shelves for racing games and 2 shelves for role-playing games, how many games did he have total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate the number of games on each shelf type. Max has 4 shelves for racing games and each shelf holds 7 games. So for the racing games, we calculate 4 shelves * 7 games/shelf = 28 racing games. Next, Max has 2 shelves for role-playing games, and similarly, for these, we calculate 2 shelves * 7 games/shelf = 14 role-playing games. Finally, we combine the two totals to find the total number of games: 28 racing games + 14 role-playing games = 42 total games.\nTherefore, the answer is (42)\n\nQ: Mark owns 12 video games, but requires 25 for his full library.

To find out how many more games he needs, we subtract the number of games he owns from the total he desires: 25 - 12 = 13 games. Each game costs $15, so to find out how much money Mark needs for 13 games, we multiply the number of games needed by the cost of each game: 13 * 15 = 195. Therefore, the total amount of money Mark needs to acquire the rest of the games is 195.\nTherefore, the answer is (195)\n\nQ: Ethan had 15 dollars. At the video game store he spent $7 on a game.

If he can finish 3 art pieces in an hour, how many hours will it take him to complete all the pieces?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out the total number of art pieces Alex has to complete. He has 9 paintings and 11 sketches. Therefore, the total number of art pieces is 9 + 11 = 20. Next, we know that Alex can finish 3 art pieces in an hour. To find out how many hours it will take him to complete all 20 pieces, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces he can finish in an hour. So, we calculate 20 / 3, which gives us approximately 6.67 hours. Since time is generally rounded to the nearest whole number when it comes to hours, we will round up since he can't work for a fraction of an hour in this scenario. Thus, it will take him 7 hours to complete all the pieces.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: A chef needed to prepare 12 dishes for a banquet. Each dish takes 3 hours to prepare.

If a crowd of 30 people shows up with 12 kids, what will the bill be?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we start by identifying the total number of people in the pizzeria, which is 30. Among these, there are 12 kids who are under 6 and do not incur any charge. To find out how many adults there are, we subtract the number of kids from the total people present: 30 total people - 12 kids = 18 adults. Next, we know that each adult pizza costs $7. Therefore, to calculate the total bill for the adult pizzas, we multiply the number of adults by the cost per adult pizza: 18 adults * $7/adult = $126. Therefore, the total bill for the pizzeria is $126.\nTherefore, the answer is (126)\n\nQ: At a buffet, adult entries are $10 and kids under 12 eat for free. If a group of 20 arrives with 8 kids, how much is the total cost for the adults?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we find the number of adults in the group. There are 20 people total and 8 of them are kids. Therefore, the number of adults is 20 - 8 = 12. Next, the cost for one adult is $10. To find the total cost for 12 adults, we multiply the number of adults by the cost per adult: 12 adults x $10/adult = $120. Thus, the total cost for the adults is $120.\nTherefore, the answer is (120)\n\nQ: At a café, each adult sandwich costs $5 and children eat at a discount. If a party of 15 people arrives and 10 are children, what will be the total cost for the group?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, identify the number of adults and children in the party. There are 15 total people and 10 are children, so there are 15 - 10 = 5 adults. Each adult sandwich costs $5. Therefore, the total cost for adults is 5 adults * $5/adult = $25. Since the problem states that children eat at a discount but does not specify the cost for children's meals, we will assume they do not add to the total cost. Thus, the total cost for the group is just the cost for the adults: $25.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: A trio of friends visited an ice cream shop. The shop had 9 cones ready but scooped out 6 more for the friends. If they each got the same amount, how many would each friend get?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine the total number of cones available. The shop originally had 9 cones and scooped out an additional 6 cones. Thus, the total number of cones is 9 + 6 = 15. Since there are 3 friends and they get the same amount of ice cream, we divide the total number of cones by the number of friends: 15 cones ÷ 3 friends = 5 cones per friend. Therefore, each friend would get 5 cones.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: At John's Diner, a group consisting of 1 adult and 6 children arrived for lunch. If each meal is priced at 4 dollars, how much will the total amount be?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of meals ordered. There is 1 adult and 6 children, so the total is 1 + 6 = 7 meals. Each meal costs 4 dollars, so the total cost is 7 meals * 4 dollars/meal = 28 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (28)\n\nQ: At a café, each adult order costs $10 and kids eat for free. If a party of 15 people arrived and 7 were kids, what would be the total cost for the party to dine?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nIn the party of 15 people, there are 7 kids. Therefore, the number of adults in the party is 15 - 7 = 8 adults. Each adult order costs $10. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of adults by the cost per adult: 8 adults * $10/adult = $80. Hence, the total cost for the party to dine is $80.\nTherefore, the answer is (80)\n\nQ: In a diner, every adult breakfast is priced at $4 and kids dine for free. If a family of 8 comes in with 4 children, how much would they need to pay for their meals?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we identify the total number of family members: there are 8 members in total. Out of these, 4 are children who dine for free, leaving us with 4 adults who will be paying for their meals. Each adult breakfast costs $4. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of paying adults (4) by the price of each adult breakfast ($4). Therefore, the total cost is 4 adults * $4/adult = $16.\nTherefore, the answer is (16)\n\nQuestion:  At a restaurant each adult meal costs $7 and kids eat free.

The store had 20 lollipops in stock and added 10 more for the family. If they shared them evenly, how many lollipops would each member of the family receive?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine the total number of lollipops available. The store initially had 20 lollipops and added 10 more, so the total becomes 20 + 10 = 30 lollipops. Next, we identify the family size. The family consists of 2 parents and 2 children, totaling 4 family members. We divide the total number of lollipops by the number of family members to find how many lollipops each member would receive. Therefore, we perform the calculation: 30 lollipops / 4 family members = 7.5 lollipops per member. Since lollipops can't be split into halves for practical purposes in sharing, we would normally say each member could take 7 lollipops fully, but mathematically, each would effectively receive 7.5 if allowed to share the total evenly.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (7.5).)\n\nQ: In a pizzeria, each adult pizza costs $7 while kids under 6 are allowed to eat at no charge.

The total number of people is 15, and 10 of them are children, so the number of adults is 15 - 10 = 5 adults. Each adult sandwich costs $5. Therefore, the cost for the adults is 5 adults * $5/adult = $25. As the question does not specify the price for children's meals, we assume children's meals are free as they are usually discounted. Hence, the total cost for the group will be just the cost of the adult sandwiches. Therefore, the total cost for the group is $25.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: At a café, each adult order costs $10 and kids eat for free. If a party of 15 people arrived and 7 were kids, what would be the total cost for the party to dine?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to identify how many adults are in the party. There are 15 people in total, and 7 of them are kids. Therefore, the number of adults can be calculated as: 15 total people - 7 kids = 8 adults. Each adult orders food costing $10. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of adults by the cost per adult: 8 adults * $10/adult = $80. Since kids eat for free, they do not contribute to the cost.

It takes 3 hours to set up each fixture, so to calculate the total time required to install the remaining 10 fixtures, we multiply the number of remaining fixtures by the time it takes to install each one: 10 fixtures * 3 hours/fixture = 30 hours. Therefore, the total time needed to complete the installation of the remaining fixtures is 30 hours.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\nQ: A new house required 12 doors. The carpenter had already fitted 5 of them. If it takes 4 hours to fit each door, how long will it take him to fit the remaining ones?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe new house requires a total of 12 doors. The carpenter has already fitted 5 doors. To find out how many doors are left to fit, we subtract the number of doors already fitted from the total number of doors needed: 12 - 5 = 7 doors remaining. Then, we need to determine how long it will take to fit these remaining doors. Given that it takes 4 hours to fit each door, we multiply the number of remaining doors by the time taken per door: 7 doors * 4 hours/door = 28 hours. Thus, the total time required to fit the remaining doors is 28 hours.\nTherefore, the answer is (28)\n\nQ: A new house required 20 doors. The contractor had already fitted 12 of them. If it takes 5 hours to install each door, how much more time will he need to install the remaining doors?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how much more time the contractor needs to install the remaining doors, we first need to find out how many doors are left to install. The total number of doors required is 20, and 12 have already been installed. Therefore, the number of remaining doors is 20 - 12 = 8 doors. Next, since it takes 5 hours to install each door, we calculate the total time needed for the remaining doors by multiplying the number of remaining doors by the time it takes to install each door. So, we have 8 doors * 5 hours/door = 40 hours. Therefore, the contractor will need 40 more hours to install the remaining doors.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: A builder is tasked with constructing 18 houses in a neighborhood.

{'question': ' Each chocolate bar in a box cost $2. If a box had 13 bars total and Rachel sold all but 4 bars, how much money would she have made? ', 'idx': 472, 'prompt': "Q: Each coffee in a cafe costs $4. If the cafe had 8 coffees total and Sara sold all but 3 coffees, how much profit would she have made?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe cafe had a total of 8 coffees. Sara sold all but 3, which means she sold 8 - 3 = 5 coffees. Each coffee costs $4, so the total revenue from selling 5 coffees is 5 * 4 = $20. Since the question does not provide any information about the cost of acquiring the coffees (e.g., how much Sara spent to purchase them), we cannot calculate a profit. Profit is defined as total revenue minus total costs, and without any cost information, we conclude there is no profit information available. Therefore, the profit made is none.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: Sara was selling her cupcakes at a school fair. She sold 10 chocolate cupcakes and 8 vanilla cupcakes. If each cupcake cost 2 dollars, how much money did she earn?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money Sara earned from selling her cupcakes, we first need to calculate the total number of cupcakes sold. Sara sold 10 chocolate cupcakes and 8 vanilla cupcakes. The total number of cupcakes is 10 + 8 = 18. Each cupcake costs 2 dollars. Therefore, the total earnings can be calculated by multiplying the total number of cupcakes by the price per cupcake: 18 cupcakes * 2 dollars/cupcake = 36 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (36)\n\nQ: Each notebook in a set costs $4. If there were 8 notebooks total and Sara used 3 notebooks, how much money would she have earned selling the others?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, determine the total cost of all notebooks. Since each notebook costs $4 and there are 8 notebooks, the total cost is 8 notebooks * $4/notebook = $32. Next, find out how many notebooks Sara has left after using 3. She used 3 out of 8, leaving her with 8 - 3 = 5 notebooks. Now, calculate how much money she would earn by selling the remaining 5 notebooks. Selling 5 notebooks at $4 each gives her 5 notebooks * $4/notebook = $20. Thus, the total earned from selling the remaining notebooks is $20.\nTherefore, the answer is (20)\n\nQ: Jessica started her own dog walking business. In the spring she made 15 dollars walking dogs and in the summer she made 35 dollars. If she had to spend 10 dollars buying treats, how much money did she end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total amount Jessica made from walking dogs in the spring and summer. In the spring, she made 15 dollars, and in the summer, she made 35 dollars. Adding these amounts gives us 15 + 35 = 50 dollars. Next, we take into account the expense of 10 dollars for buying treats. We subtract the cost of the treats from the total earnings: 50 - 10 = 40 dollars. Therefore, Jessica ended up with 40 dollars after her expenses.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: Each cookie jar in a store costs $4. If a jar had 20 cookies total and Emma sold all but 8 cookies, how much money would she have made?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we note that the jar initially had 20 cookies. Emma sold all but 8 cookies, which means she sold 20 - 8 = 12 cookies. Since each cookie jar costs $4, we need to determine if Emma sold the cookies individually or in jars. There is no indication in the problem that Emma sold the cookies in jars or that the cookie jar's cost impacts the selling of individual cookies. Therefore, we do not know how much each cookie was sold for, nor do we have sufficient information about the selling process. Hence, we conclude that we cannot determine how much money she made from selling cookies with the given information.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: Max's candy store was conducting a promotion where each chocolate bar was 2 dollars. If Max started with 40 bars and had 15 bars left, how much money did he earn?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMax started with 40 chocolate bars and had 15 bars left after the promotion. To find out how many bars were sold, we subtract the number of bars left from the original amount: 40 - 15 = 25 bars sold. Each bar was sold for 2 dollars, so to calculate the total earnings, we multiply the number of bars sold by the price per bar: 25 bars * 2 dollars/bar = 50 dollars. Therefore, Max earned 50 dollars from the promotion.\nTherefore, the answer is (50)\n\nQ: Sarah opened her own baking business. In the spring she made 40 dollars selling cupcakes and in the summer she made 60 dollars. If she had to spend 15 dollars on ingredients, how much money did she end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total income Sarah made from selling cupcakes in the spring and summer. In the spring, she made 40 dollars, and in the summer, she made 60 dollars. Adding these together gives us 40 + 60 = 100 dollars. Next, we consider the expenses she incurred for ingredients, which were 15 dollars. To find out how much money she ended up with, we subtract her expenses from her total income: 100 - 15 = 85 dollars. Therefore, the final amount Sarah has after her sales and expenses is 85 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (85)\n\nQ: Lily was selling her baked goods at a bake sale. She sold 12 chocolate cookies and 8 blueberry muffins. If each item cost 2 dollars, how much money did she earn?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine the total number of items sold. Lily sold 12 chocolate cookies and 8 blueberry muffins. We add these two amounts together: 12 + 8 = 20 items sold. Next, we know that each item costs 2 dollars. To find the total money earned, we multiply the total number of items sold by the cost per item: 20 items * 2 dollars/item = 40 dollars. Therefore, the answer is (40).\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQuestion:  Each chocolate bar in a box cost $2.

If she had to pick up 5 bags from one pile and 5 bags from another, how many trips will she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nElla needs to carry mulch from two piles. Each pile requires her to pick up 5 bags of mulch. Since she can carry 5 bags at a time, she can pick up one pile in one trip. Therefore, for the first pile, she makes one trip and for the second pile, she makes another trip. This results in a total of 2 trips. Thus, the answer is the total number of trips she makes to pick up mulch from both piles.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQ: A family of 5 went to a bakery. The baker already had 10 pastries made but baked 5 more for the family. If they each got the same amount, how many would each person get?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of pastries. The baker had 10 pastries and baked 5 more, so the total is 10 + 5 = 15 pastries. Next, we need to divide these 15 pastries among the 5 family members evenly. We perform the division: 15 pastries / 5 family members = 3 pastries per person. Therefore, each person gets 3 pastries.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: Sara needed to cook 12 meals and bake 15 desserts before the party.

She needed to cook 12 meals and bake 15 desserts. Adding these together gives us a total of 12 + 15 = 27 items. By the time the guests arrived, she had prepared 6 of these items. To find out how many she did not prepare, we subtract the number of items she prepared from the total number she needed to prepare: 27 - 6 = 21. Therefore, Sara did not prepare 21 items before the guests arrived.\nTherefore, the answer is (21)\n\nQ: For a family gathering, Sarah prepared 15 cupcakes and 30 cookies. If her dessert table can only hold 5 of each item, how many trays will she use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many trays Sarah will need for the desserts. Each tray can hold 5 cupcakes and 5 cookies. Sarah made 15 cupcakes and 30 cookies. We will calculate how many trays are needed for cupcakes and cookies separately. For the cupcakes: 15 cupcakes / 5 cupcakes per tray = 3 trays. For the cookies: 30 cookies / 5 cookies per tray = 6 trays. Next, we need to consider the total number of trays used, which is the greater of the two quantities. Since she needs 6 trays for cookies, Sarah will use 6 trays in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: For the school event, Anna baked goods. She made 15 cookies and 5 brownies. After the event she had 10 to take back home. How many goods did she sell?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of baked goods Anna made by adding the cookies and brownies together. She made 15 cookies and 5 brownies, resulting in a total of 15 + 5 = 20 baked goods. After the event, she had 10 goods remaining. Therefore, to find out how many goods she sold, we subtract the number of goods she took back home from the total number she made. This gives us 20 - 10 = 10 baked goods sold.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Lily whipped up 3 cakes, but needed 7 total for the festival. If she used 2 cups of icing on each one, how many cups does she still need?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLily needs a total of 7 cakes for the festival, and she has already made 3 cakes. To find out how many more cakes she needs, we subtract the number of cakes she has from the total needed: 7 - 3 = 4. Therefore, she still needs to make 4 more cakes. Each cake requires 2 cups of icing. We then calculate the total amount of icing needed for the remaining cakes: 4 cakes * 2 cups per cake = 8 cups of icing needed in total. Now we focus on the icing already used. Since she has already made 3 cakes and each cake uses 2 cups, we find out how much icing she has already used: 3 cakes * 2 cups per cake = 6 cups of icing. To find out how many cups of icing she still needs, we calculate the total needed icing (8 cups) and subtract the icing already used (6 cups): 8 - 6 = 2. Thus, she still needs 2 cups of icing.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQuestion:  Isabel baked 3 brownies, but needed 5 total for her party.

If a gathering of 18 guests consists of 6 children, how much will the group have to pay?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we identify the total number of guests at the gathering, which is 18. Among these, 6 are children. Since all children eat at no cost, we need to calculate the number of adult meals paid by the group. The number of adults can be determined by subtracting the number of children from the total guests: 18 - 6 = 12 adults. Next, we calculate the total cost for the adult meals. Each adult meal is priced at $6, so we multiply the number of adult meals by the price per meal: 12 adults * $6/adult = $72.

If a party of 15 people arrives and 10 are children, what will be the total cost for the group?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total cost for the group, we need to determine how many adults and children there are and their respective costs. There are 15 people in total, with 10 children. Therefore, the number of adults is 15 - 10 = 5 adults. Each adult sandwich costs $5. The total cost for the adult sandwiches is 5 adults * $5/adult = $25. Children eat at a discount, but the problem does not specify the price for children. However, since we only have the adult price provided, we will assume the cost for children's food contributes $0 for this calculation. Therefore, the total cost for the group is $25 for the adults, and the children's costs do not add to it.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: At a buffet, adult entries are $10 and kids under 12 eat for free.

Start with the initial number of lollipops, which is 20. 2. The store adds 10 more lollipops to the initial stock, bringing the total to 20 + 10 = 30 lollipops. 3. The family consists of 4 members: 2 parents and 2 children. 4. To find out how many lollipops each member receives, divide the total number of lollipops by the number of family members: 30 lollipops ÷ 4 family members = 7.5 lollipops per member. 5. Since they cannot practically share half a lollipop equally, we still take the calculated average for understanding distribution. Thus, each member effectively shares 7.5 lollipops in terms of even distribution but will have to decide on physical halves when consuming them.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (7.5).)\n\nQ: At John's Diner, a group consisting of 1 adult and 6 children arrived for lunch.

There are 10 customers in total and 4 of them are children, which means there are 10 - 4 = 6 adults. Each adult drink costs $5, so for the adults, the total cost is 6 * 5 = $30. For the children, the cost of a drink is half the price of the adult drink, which is $5 / 2 = $2.50. Since there are 4 children, the total cost for the children's drinks is 4 * 2.50 = $10. Now, we add the cost for adults and children: $30 (adult drinks) + $10 (children's drinks) = $40. Therefore, the total cost for the family to enjoy their drinks is $40.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: In a diner, every adult breakfast is priced at $4 and kids dine for free.

Each adult drink costs $5, and there are 10 customers total, with 4 being children. This means there are 10 - 4 = 6 adults. The cost for the adult drinks is 6 adults * $5/adult = $30. For the children, their drinks cost half price, which is $5 / 2 = $2.50 per child. The cost for the children's drinks is 4 children * $2.50/child = $10.

If she had only completed 20 of them before the event started, how many did she not finish?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of baked goods Maria needed to make: 24 cookies + 16 brownies = 40 baked goods. Next, determine how many she completed before the event started, which is 20. To find out how many she did not finish, subtract the number completed from the total needed: 40 - 20 = 20. Therefore, Maria did not finish 20 baked goods.\nTherefore, the answer is (20)\n\nQ: Emma baked 24 cookies and 36 brownies for the bake sale. If she arranged the treats into 6 gift boxes with an equal number of items in each box, how many treats were in each box?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find the total number of treats by adding the cookies and brownies. Emma baked 24 cookies and 36 brownies. Total treats = 24 + 36 = 60. Next, we need to divide the total number of treats by the number of gift boxes to find out how many treats are in each box. Emma arranged the treats into 6 gift boxes, so we divide the total treats by 6: 60 ÷ 6 = 10.

If she used 2 cups of icing on each one, how many cups does she still need?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLily needs a total of 7 cakes for the festival but has only made 3 cakes so far. To find out how many more cakes she needs, we subtract the number of cakes she has from the total needed: 7 - 3 = 4. Therefore, she needs to make 4 more cakes. Each cake requires 2 cups of icing, so for 4 cakes, she will need a total of 4 * 2 = 8 cups of icing. Since she has already used icing on the 3 cakes, the total amount of icing she has used so far is 3 * 2 = 6 cups. Now, we subtract the amount of icing she has used from the total amount she will need: 8 - 6 = 2 cups. Therefore, Lily still needs 2 cups of icing.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQ: Sarah opened her own baking business.

On Tuesday, he worked 6 hours, and on Wednesday, he worked 4 hours. How much did Chris earn in those two days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate Chris's earnings for the two days, we first need to find out how much he earned on each day separately and then sum those amounts. On Tuesday, he worked for 6 hours. His hourly wage is 9 dollars. Thus, for Tuesday, his earnings can be calculated as 6 hours * 9 dollars/hour = 54 dollars. On Wednesday, he worked for 4 hours. Using the same hourly rate, his earnings for Wednesday will be 4 hours * 9 dollars/hour = 36 dollars. Now, we will add the earnings from both days: 54 dollars (Tuesday) + 36 dollars (Wednesday) = 90 dollars. Therefore, the total amount Chris earned in those two days is 90 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (90)\n\nQ: David was working as a maintenance worker at an apartment complex where he earned 9 dollars an hour.

There are 15 people in total and 7 of them are kids. Therefore, the number of adults is 15 - 7 = 8 adults. Next, we calculate the total cost for the adults. Each adult's order costs $10. Thus, the total cost for the 8 adults is 8 adults * $10/adult = $80. Since kids eat for free, there are no additional costs for the 7 kids.

The store originally had 20 lollipops and added 10 more, resulting in a total of 20 + 10 = 30 lollipops. Next, we determine the number of members in the family. There are 2 adults and 2 children, totaling 4 family members. To find out how many lollipops each member would receive, we divide the total number of lollipops by the number of family members: 30 lollipops / 4 family members = 7.5 lollipops per member.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (7.5).)\n\nQ: In a bistro, adult dishes are priced at $12 and kids' meals are complimentary.

There are a total of 20 individuals and 5 of them are kids, so we subtract the kids from the total to find the adults: 20 - 5 = 15 adults. Next, we calculate the total cost of adult dishes. Since each adult dish is priced at $12, we multiply the number of adults by the price per dish: 15 adults * $12/adult = $180. Therefore, the total cost for the adults is $180.\nTherefore, the answer is (180)\n\nQ: At a cafe, each adult meal costs $10 and children eat for free.

If a family of 10 customers arrived and 4 were children, how much would it cost for the family to enjoy their drinks?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we identify how many adults and children are in the family. There are 10 customers in total, and 4 of them are children. This implies that there are 10 - 4 = 6 adults in the family. Next, we calculate the cost of drinks for adults and children. Each adult drink costs $5, so for 6 adults, the total cost for adult drinks is 6 * 5 = $30. The children get drinks for half price, which means each child's drink costs $5 / 2 = $2.50. For 4 children, the total cost for children's drinks is 4 * 2.50 = $10. Now, to find the total cost for the family, we simply add the cost of adult drinks and the cost of children's drinks: $30 (adults) + $10 (children) = $40.

If she needed to collect 24 cans from one bin and 6 from another, how many trips will she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of cans Ava needs to collect. She needs to collect 24 cans from one bin and 6 cans from another bin. Adding these amounts together gives us a total of 24 + 6 = 30 cans. Ava can carry a maximum of 12 cans at a time. To find out how many trips she needs to make, we divide the total number of cans by the number she can carry in one trip. 30 cans ÷ 12 cans per trip = 2.5 trips. Since Ava cannot make half a trip, she will need to round this up to the next whole number, which is 3 trips. Therefore, the answer is (3).\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: Sara was assisting the janitors in collecting recycling bins, but she could only carry 3 bins at a time. If she had to pick up 12 bins from one room and 9 bins from another, how many trips will she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of bins Sara needs to collect. She has to pick up 12 bins from one room and 9 bins from another room. We add these two amounts together: 12 + 9 = 21 bins total. Next, since Sara can carry only 3 bins at a time, we need to divide the total number of bins by the number of bins she can carry in one trip: 21 bins ÷ 3 bins/trip = 7 trips. Therefore, Sara will need to make 7 trips to collect all the bins.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Quinn was gathering plastic bags for recycling. On Thursday they filled 4 containers and on Friday they filled 2 more containers. If each container had 15 bags in it, how many bags did they gather in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of containers filled by Quinn. On Thursday, they filled 4 containers, and on Friday, they filled an additional 2 containers. Adding these gives us 4 + 2 = 6 containers in total. Each container holds 15 bags, so we now multiply the total number of containers by the number of bags each container holds: 6 containers * 15 bags/container = 90 bags. Thus, the total number of bags gathered is 90.\nTherefore, the answer is (90)\n\nQ: Olivia gained 12 points for each shirt she recycled. If she had 10 shirts, but didn't recycle 3 of them, how many points would she have earned?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nOlivia had a total of 10 shirts but did not recycle 3 of them. To find out how many shirts she actually recycled, we subtract the number of shirts not recycled from the total number of shirts: 10 shirts - 3 shirts = 7 shirts recycled. Each shirt recycled earns her 12 points, so we multiply the number of shirts recycled by the points earned per shirt: 7 shirts * 12 points/shirt = 84 points. Therefore, Olivia would have earned a total of 84 points.\nTherefore, the answer is (84)\n\nQ: Karen and her group were collecting cans for a recycling competition. For every 6 pounds they collected, they earned one point. If Karen collected 18 pounds and her group collected 12 pounds, how many points did they earn?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total pounds of cans collected by Karen and her group. Karen collected 18 pounds and her group collected 12 pounds, so the total is 18 + 12 = 30 pounds. Next, determine how many points they earned by dividing the total pounds collected by the number of pounds needed for one point (6 pounds per point). So, we calculate 30 / 6 = 5 points. Therefore, the total points earned is 5.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Sofia wanted to improve her craft supplies. She collected 25 items from a friend and bought 10 more at a craft fair. If 8 of them were unusable, how many good items did she have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSofia initially collected 25 items from her friend and then bought 10 more at a craft fair. The total number of items she has is 25 + 10 = 35. Out of the 35 items, 8 were unusable. To find out how many good items she has left, we subtract the unusable items from the total: 35 - 8 = 27.

If she had to pick up 10 bags from the porch and 5 bags from the car, how many trips will she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of bags Emma has to carry. She has 10 bags from the porch and 5 bags from the car. This means she has a total of 10 + 5 = 15 bags. Emma can carry 7 bags at a time. To calculate the number of trips, we divide the total number of bags (15) by the number of bags she can carry (7). Going through the division: 15 divided by 7 gives us 2 full trips with a remainder, meaning after 2 trips (14 bags), there will be 1 bag left. Since she has to carry that remaining bag, she needs to make a third trip. Thus, the total number of trips Emma will make is 3.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: Sarah was assisting the janitors in collecting dirty laundry, but she could only carry 15 bags at a time. If she had to pick up 22 bags from one room and 35 bags from another, how many trips will she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of bags Sarah needs to collect. She has to pick up 22 bags from one room and 35 bags from another room. Adding these together gives a total of 22 + 35 = 57 bags. Since Sarah can carry 15 bags at a time, we need to determine how many trips she will need to make to collect all 57 bags. To find the number of trips, divide the total number of bags by the number of bags she can carry in one trip: 57 bags / 15 bags per trip = 3.8 trips. Since she cannot make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number, which means she will need to make 4 trips in total. Therefore, the answer is (4).\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQuestion:  Megan earned 8 points for each bag of cans she recycled.

However, the problem only asks for the tickets used for the log flume rides. Since only the flume ride cost is provided and needed to answer, we don't need information about the ring toss. Thus, the total tickets used by John for the rides is purely from the log flume rides, which sums up to 21 tickets.\nTherefore, the answer is (21)\n\nQ: Liam was helping the event organizers arrange chairs, but he could only carry 7 chairs at a time. If he had to set up 28 chairs in one section and 14 chairs in another, how many trips will he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of chairs Liam needs to arrange. He needs to set up 28 chairs in one section and 14 chairs in another. We can add these together: 28 + 14 = 42 chairs in total. Since Liam can only carry 7 chairs at a time, we need to divide the total number of chairs by the number of chairs he can carry in one trip: 42 ÷ 7 = 6 trips. Therefore, the number of trips Liam will make is 6.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: At the winter festival, Ethan went ice skating 3 times and rode the snow slide 4 times.

If her cousin, Luke, finished 4 of them, how many servings could she offer if she cut 2 slices from each pie?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nElla initially made 12 pies. If she cuts 2 slices from each pie, that means for each pie, there are 2 servings. Therefore, the total servings from all pies would be 12 pies * 2 slices per pie = 24 slices. However, since Luke finished 4 pies, we need to calculate how many slices were consumed from those pies. Luke's consumption is 4 pies * 2 slices per pie = 8 slices. Thus, the remaining servings from the untouched pies would be 24 total slices - 8 slices eaten by Luke = 16 slices. Ella could offer 16 servings from the remaining pies.\nTherefore, the answer is (16)\n\nQ: Mike was tasked with baking 5 cakes and 12 pies for the bake sale.

Therefore, he did not finish 7 items.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Ella harvested 28 apples from her tree and picked 12 apples from a neighbor's orchard. If she sorted the apples into 4 different baskets with the same number of apples in each basket, how many apples were in each of the baskets?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of apples Ella has. She harvested 28 apples from her tree and picked 12 apples from her neighbor's orchard. We add these two amounts together: 28 + 12 = 40 apples. Next, Ella wants to sort these 40 apples into 4 different baskets with the same number of apples in each basket. We divide the total number of apples by the number of baskets: 40 ÷ 4 = 10 apples per basket. Therefore, each basket contains 10 apples.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: A family of 4 visited a bakery. The baker had 12 cookies ready but baked 8 more for the family. If they divided them equally, how many cookies would each person get?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe bakery initially had 12 cookies and baked 8 more for the family. We first calculate the total number of cookies: 12 + 8 = 20 cookies. The family consists of 4 members.

To find the combined points scored by the other players, we subtract Tom's points from the total score: 45 - 15 = 30 points. Each other player scored 5 points. To find the number of other players, we take the total points they scored (30) and divide it by the points per player (5): 30 / 5 = 6. Therefore, there are 6 other players. Including Tom, the total number of players on the team is 6 + 1 = 7.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: A basketball team consists of 15 players, but during a match 5 players were injured.

Emily scored 22 points. We subtract Emily's points from the total to find how many points the other players scored: 72 - 22 = 50 points. Each of the other players scored 6 points. To find the number of other players, we divide the points scored by the other players by the points each one scored: 50 / 6 = 8.33. Since the number of players must be a whole number, this indicates that our earlier calculations hastily. If we include Emily in the count, the formula for the number of players then becomes 1 (Emily) plus the number of other players. Assuming there are no other variables affecting the point totals, the total number of players is thus floor(50 / 6) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 players or 8 total contributing players. So, we conclude there are 8 other players alongside Emily.\nTherefore, the answer is (9)\n\nQuestion:  Paige's team won their dodgeball game and scored 41 points total.

If she had to pick up 18 bags from one pile and 10 bags from another, how many trips will she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSophie needs to pick up a total of bags from two piles. First, from one pile, she has to pick up 18 bags. Since she can carry only 6 bags at a time, the number of trips for the first pile can be calculated by dividing 18 by 6, which is 3 trips. Next, from the second pile, she has to pick up 10 bags. Similarly, for the second pile, the number of trips can be calculated by dividing 10 by 6, which gives approximately 1.67. Since Sophie cannot make a fraction of a trip, we round up this to 2 trips. Therefore, the total number of trips she will make is 3 (for the first pile) + 2 (for the second pile), which equals 5 trips.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Clara set out to plant 4 types of flowers and 16 types of vegetables in her garden.

Since he only finished baking 10 of the pies before the sale started, we need to subtract the number of pies he baked from the total number of pies. Therefore, the number of pies he did not bake is: 40 - 10 = 30. \nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\nQ: A trio of classmates went to a café. The barista had 9 muffins available and baked 6 more for the students. If they equally share all the muffins, how many muffins does each student receive?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find the total number of muffins available. The barista had 9 muffins and baked 6 more. Therefore, the total number of muffins is 9 + 6 = 15. Next, there are 3 classmates who will share these muffins equally. To find out how many muffins each student receives, we need to divide the total number of muffins by the number of students. Thus, 15 muffins / 3 students = 5 muffins per student.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Ella whipped up 12 pies for a family gathering. If her cousin, Luke, finished 4 of them, how many servings could she offer if she cut 2 slices from each pie?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nElla made 12 pies. If she cuts 2 slices from each pie, the total number of servings she can offer is calculated as follows: 12 pies * 2 slices per pie = 24 slices. However, Luke finished 4 pies, which means Ella has 12 - 4 = 8 pies left. Therefore, the number of servings she can offer now is 8 pies * 2 slices per pie = 16 slices.\nTherefore, the answer is (16)\n\nQ: Sara had 92 pieces of fruit to divide. She selected 22 of them for a fruit salad, but opted to split the rest into 6 equal baskets. How many pieces of fruit could go in each basket?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSara starts with 92 pieces of fruit. She selects 22 pieces for a fruit salad. To find out how many pieces are left after the selection for the fruit salad, we subtract the number of pieces selected from the total number of pieces. That is, 92 - 22 = 70 pieces left. Next, she decides to divide these remaining 70 pieces into 6 equal baskets. To find out how many pieces can go in each basket, we perform the division: 70 divided by 6. Upon performing the division, we find that 70 / 6 = 11 with a remainder of 4. This means that each basket can have 11 pieces and there will be 4 pieces left over. Therefore, since the question asks how many pieces of fruit could go in each basket, we only consider the whole number results from the division, which is 11.\nTherefore, the answer is (11)\n\nQ: A fruit stand had 36 apples. In one afternoon they sold 12 of them and organized the rest into bags with 6 in each bag. How many bags did they fill?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe fruit stand started with 36 apples. They sold 12 apples, so we need to subtract the sold apples from the total. This leaves us with 36 - 12 = 24 apples. Next, we need to organize the remaining apples into bags, with each bag containing 6 apples. To find the number of bags, we divide the number of remaining apples by the number of apples per bag: 24 apples / 6 apples per bag = 4 bags. Therefore, they filled 4 bags.\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQ: A class of 6 students went on a field trip. The teacher had 12 snacks prepared but brought 6 more for the students. If they each got the same amount, how many would each student get?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out the total number of snacks prepared for the students. The teacher initially had 12 snacks and then brought 6 more. Therefore, we calculate the total number of snacks as follows: 12 + 6 = 18 snacks. Next, we need to distribute these 18 snacks evenly among the 6 students. To do this, we divide the total number of snacks by the number of students: 18 snacks ÷ 6 students = 3 snacks per student. Thus, each student would get 3 snacks.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: A trio of friends visited an ice cream shop. The shop had 9 cones ready but scooped out 6 more for the friends.

On Wednesday, she filled 7 crates. On Thursday, she filled 2 more crates. To find the total number of crates, we add these two amounts: 7 + 2 = 9 crates. Next, we need to calculate how many containers were collected. Each crate holds 8 containers, so we multiply the total number of crates by the number of containers per crate: 9 crates * 8 containers/crate = 72 containers. Thus, the total number of containers collected is 72.\nTherefore, the answer is (72)\n\nQ: The pet shop brought in 14 puppies and 30 kittens for adoption day. But, if only 35 people came by, how many extra animals did the shop have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of animals available for adoption. The shop brought in 14 puppies and 30 kittens. Adding these together gives us 14 + 30 = 44 animals. Next, we note that only 35 people came by to adopt animals. Since each person can adopt at least one animal, we compare the number of animals to the number of potential adopters. We find that there are 44 animals minus 35 potential adopters, which results in 44 - 35 = 9 extra animals. Therefore, the shop had 9 extra animals after adoption day.\nTherefore, the answer is (9)\n\nQ: David is at the warehouse packaging goods. There are 90 packages to process total but a supervisor takes 30 of them and leaves David with the rest.

Since the number of questions per page must be a whole number, we can conclude that there might be an inconsistency in the given information. However, without additional details, we must state that it cannot evenly divide into pages without fractions.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (6.25).)\n\nQ: Mia received 25 chemistry problems and 15 physics questions for her homework. If she solved 30 of them during her study session, how many problems did she have left to do at home?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of chemistry and physics problems Mia received. She received 25 chemistry problems and 15 physics questions. We sum these two numbers: 25 + 15 = 40 problems in total. Next, we know that Mia solved 30 of these problems during her study session. To find out how many problems she has left to do, we subtract the number of problems she solved from the total number of problems: 40 - 30 = 10 problems remaining. Therefore, the number of problems Mia has left to do at home is 10.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Emily bought four sticker albums. One had 12 pages, another had 25, and the last two had 15 each. After one week, she filled 35 pages with stickers. How many pages does she still need to fill?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of pages in all four sticker albums. The first album has 12 pages, the second has 25 pages, and the last two each have 15 pages. Thus, the total pages can be calculated as follows: 12 + 25 + 15 + 15 = 67 pages. After one week, Emily filled 35 pages with stickers. To find out how many pages she still needs to fill, we subtract the number of pages she filled from the total number of pages: 67 - 35 = 32 pages. Therefore, the number of pages she still needs to fill is 32.\nTherefore, the answer is (32)\n\nQ: Chris had 30 reading assignments. He finished 18 of them but still has 2 books to read. If each book has the same number of pages, how many pages are in each book?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nChris had a total of 30 reading assignments. He finished 18 of them, which leaves him with 30 - 18 = 12 assignments. However, we know he still has 2 books to read, indicating that these 2 books are part of those remaining assignments. Consequently, the remaining assignments consist of 12 - 2 = 10 assignments that are not books. To conclude, we cannot determine the number of pages in each book because there isn't enough information provided regarding the total page count of the books or any details about the pages per assignment.\nTherefore, the answer is (None)\n\nQ: Emma purchased five puzzle books. One contained 40 puzzles, while another had 18, and the last three had 25 each. After ten days she completed 70 puzzles. How many puzzles does she still need to complete?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find the total number of puzzles in the five puzzle books. We have one book with 40 puzzles, one with 18 puzzles, and three books with 25 puzzles each. The total can be calculated as follows: total puzzles = 40 + 18 + (3 * 25). This gives us total puzzles = 40 + 18 + 75, which equals 133 puzzles. Emma has completed 70 puzzles in ten days. To find out how many puzzles she still needs to complete, we subtract the puzzles completed from the total puzzles: puzzles remaining = total puzzles - puzzles completed = 133 - 70, which equals 63 puzzles. Therefore, the answer is (63).\nTherefore, the answer is (63)\n\nQuestion:  Megan had 40 homework problems. She finished 26 of them but still had 2 pages of problems to do.

In one day they sold 15 of them and placed the remaining flowers in containers with 4 in each container. How many containers did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there are 40 bouquets. After selling 15, the number of remaining bouquets is calculated as: 40 - 15 = 25. To find out how many containers are needed, we take the remaining bouquets and divide them by the number of bouquets that can fit in each container, which is 4. Therefore, 25 divided by 4 gives us 6 with a remainder of 1. This means 6 full containers are used, and one bouquet remains that cannot fill another container. So, they only use 6 containers in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: Jessica was sorting her art supplies ensuring that each box contained exactly 10 items. If she had 3 boxes filled with paints and 4 boxes filled with brushes, how many items did she have in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine the total number of items in the boxes of paints. Jessica has 3 boxes of paints, each containing 10 items. Therefore, the total number of items from the paints is 3 boxes * 10 items/box = 30 items. Next, we calculate the total number of items in the boxes of brushes. Jessica has 4 boxes of brushes, each also containing 10 items. Thus, the total number of items from the brushes is 4 boxes * 10 items/box = 40 items. Finally, we add the total items from both types: 30 items (paints) + 40 items (brushes) = 70 items. Therefore, the total number of items Jessica has is 70.\nTherefore, the answer is (70)\n\nQ: The flower shop arranged 80 bouquets and 30 single stems for a wedding. But, if only 15 guests arrived for the ceremony, how many extra flowers were left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the flower shop prepared 80 bouquets and 30 single stems. The total number of flowers prepared for the wedding is 80 (bouquets) + 30 (single stems) = 110 flowers. However, only 15 guests arrived for the ceremony. Assuming each guest would take one flower, a total of 15 flowers would be needed. To find out how many extra flowers were left, we subtract the number of flowers used (15) from the total number of flowers prepared (110): 110 - 15 = 95. Therefore, there are 95 extra flowers left.\nTherefore, the answer is (95)\n\nQ: Sophia gathered 10 flowers from her garden.

To find out how many books remain, we subtract the 20 books from the total: 60 - 20 = 40 books left. Then, she decides to distribute these 40 books into 8 equal shelves. To find out how many books go on each shelf, we will divide the remaining books by the number of shelves: 40 ÷ 8 = 5. Therefore, each of the smaller shelves can hold 5 books.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Alex was assisting the library staff with returning books, but he could only carry 6 books at a time. If he needed to return 10 books from one shelf and 4 from another, how many trips will he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of books Alex needs to return. He has 10 books from one shelf and 4 from another shelf, which adds up to 10 + 4 = 14 books in total. Since Alex can carry 6 books at a time, we determine how many trips he needs to make by dividing the total number of books by the number of books he can carry in one trip. We perform the operation: 14 ÷ 6 = 2.3333. This means Alex will need to make 3 trips to return all the books, as he can't make a partial trip. The first trip can carry 6 books, the second trip can carry another 6 books, and the final trip will carry the last 2 books, totaling 14 books returned.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQuestion:  Mike is at the library helping put away books.

If each crate held 8 containers, how many containers did she collect in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nOn Wednesday, Sarah filled 7 crates, and on Thursday, she filled 2 more crates. To find the total number of crates filled, we add the crates from both days: 7 + 2 = 9 crates. Each crate holds 8 containers, so the total number of containers Sarah collected is: 9 crates * 8 containers/crate = 72 containers.\nTherefore, the answer is (72)\n\nQ: The toy store had 200 toys. They sold 70 toys during the weekend and decided to donate the rest to charity. If each donation box holds 10 toys, how many boxes can they fill?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe toy store originally had 200 toys. They sold 70 toys during the weekend. To find out how many toys are left to donate, we subtract the number of toys sold from the original number: 200 - 70 = 130 toys left. Now, since each donation box can hold 10 toys, we need to divide the number of remaining toys by the capacity of each box: 130 / 10 = 13 boxes. Therefore, the store can fill 13 donation boxes with the remaining toys.\nTherefore, the answer is (13)\n\nQ: The toy store received 80 new toys. They donated 15 to charity and opted to use the leftover for displays. If each display needs 10 toys, how many displays can they set up?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we start with the total number of toys received, which is 80. Next, we subtract the number of toys donated to charity, which is 15. This gives us the number of toys left for displays: 80 - 15 = 65 toys. To find out how many displays can be set up, we need to divide the number of leftover toys by the number of toys needed for each display, which is 10. Therefore, we calculate 65 / 10 = 6.5. Since we can't set up a fraction of a display, we round down to the nearest whole number. Hence, the total number of displays that can be set up is 6.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: The pet shop brought in 14 puppies and 30 kittens for adoption day. But, if only 35 people came by, how many extra animals did the shop have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the total number of animals brought in by the pet shop, which is the sum of puppies and kittens. The shop brought in 14 puppies and 30 kittens. So, the total number of animals is 14 + 30 = 44 animals. Next, we consider the number of people that came by for adoption, which is 35. We want to find out how many extra animals there are after every person adopted an animal. Since there are 44 animals and 35 people, we subtract the number of people from the total number of animals: 44 - 35 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 extra animals remaining after the adoption day.\nTherefore, the answer is (9)\n\nQ: Tom was picking up cardboard for recycling. On the weekend he filled 8 crates and on the next day he filled 4 more crates. If each crate had 6 pieces of cardboard in it, how many pieces did he collect in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTom filled 8 crates on the weekend and 4 more crates the next day. First, we need to calculate the total number of crates filled. This is done by adding the two numbers: 8 crates + 4 crates = 12 crates in total. Each crate contains 6 pieces of cardboard. To find the total number of pieces of cardboard, we multiply the total number of crates by the number of pieces per crate: 12 crates * 6 pieces per crate = 72 pieces of cardboard. Therefore, the total number of pieces of cardboard collected is 72.\nTherefore, the answer is (72)\n\nQ: A pet shelter had 50 kittens.

How many slots does she still have to fill?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nNatalie acquired two photo albums with a total of 28 slots and 50 slots, which means the total number of slots combined is 28 + 50 = 78 slots. After filling 40 slots with photos, the number of remaining slots is calculated by subtracting the number of filled slots from the total slots: 78 - 40 = 38. Therefore, she still has 38 slots to fill.\nTherefore, the answer is (38)\n\nQ: Sophia was filing her photo prints in an album with 3 on each page. If she had 2 new photos and 14 old photos to include in the album, how many pages would she fill?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of photos Sophia has. She has 2 new photos and 14 old photos. Adding these together gives us a total of 2 + 14 = 16 photos. Since each page in the album can hold 3 photos, we can find out how many pages she will fill by dividing the total number of photos by the number of photos per page. Thus, we calculate 16 photos ÷ 3 photos per page = 5 pages with a remainder of 1 photo. Since she cannot fill a complete new page with just 1 photo, she will only need 5 pages to fill the album.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: On a recent vacation, Sarah took 60 photographs at the park and 5 at the restaurant. After some time, she decided to delete 25 of them. How many photographs from her vacation does she still possess?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSarah took a total of 60 photographs at the park and 5 at the restaurant. To find the total number of photographs she initially took, we add these two numbers together: 60 + 5 = 65. Later, she decided to delete 25 of these photographs. To find out how many photographs she still possesses, we subtract the deleted photographs from the total: 65 - 25 = 40. Therefore, Sarah still possesses 40 photographs from her vacation.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: Alex posted 45 photos on Instagram. He placed 30 pics into one folder and distributed the remaining ones into 4 separate folders. How many photos were in each folder?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nAlex posted a total of 45 photos on Instagram. He placed 30 photos in one folder. To find out how many are left for the other folders, we subtract the 30 photos from the total: 45 - 30 = 15 photos. These remaining 15 photos are then distributed into 4 separate folders. We can find the number of photos per folder by dividing the 15 photos by the 4 folders: 15 / 4 = 3.75 photos per folder. Since we cannot have a fraction of a photo in this context, this problem assumes an equal distribution without concern for the actual indivisibility. Thus, we conclude that the distribution of photos among the folders might not be even due to this indivisibility issue. However, in terms of simple equal distribution, theoretically, each folder would have about 3 photos, and there would be 3 remaining photos that need to be allocated somehow, potentially leading to 3 folders having 4 photos each and 1 folder retaining 3 photos. Therefore, under typical conditions, the absolute answer cannot be derived because it depends on how the leftover photos are dealt with, thus completing the reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (45)\n\nQ: Laura sought to improve her music album collection. She bought 25 CDs from a friend and added 4 more during a sale. If 6 of the CDs were scratched, how many playable albums did she end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, let's find out how many CDs Laura bought in total. She bought 25 CDs from a friend and then added 4 more during a sale. Therefore, the total number of CDs she has is 25 + 4 = 29 CDs. Next, we need to account for the scratched CDs. She has 6 scratched CDs out of the total 29 CDs. To find the number of playable albums, we subtract the scratched CDs from the total CDs. So, 29 - 6 = 23 playable CDs. Hence, the final count of playable albums she has is 23.\nTherefore, the answer is (23)\n\nQ: Julia was collecting stamps for her collection. On Wednesday she acquired 4 albums and on Thursday she got 5 more albums.

On Wednesday she got 4 albums and on Thursday she got 5 more albums. Adding those together, we get 4 + 5 = 9 albums in total. Next, we find out how many stamps there are in total by multiplying the total number of albums by the number of stamps per album. Each album contains 12 stamps, so we calculate 9 albums * 12 stamps/album = 108 stamps. Therefore, Julia has 108 stamps in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (108)\n\nQ: Mark had 200 photographs on his camera. He deleted 50 of them and grouped the remaining into albums with 20 photos in each album. How many albums did Mark end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMark started with 200 photographs. After deleting 50, he has 200 - 50 = 150 photographs remaining. He then groups these remaining photographs into albums containing 20 photos each. To find out how many albums he can create, we divide the number of remaining photographs by the number of photos per album: 150 / 20 = 7.5. Since Mark cannot have a partial album, we take the whole number part of the division, which is 7. Thus, Mark can create 7 complete albums with 20 photos each.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Sophie was filing her photographs in an album with 3 on each page.

{'question': " Emily's team won their dodgeball game and scored 39 points total. If Emily scored 23 of the points and everyone else scored 2 points each, how many players were on her team? ", 'idx': 532, 'prompt': "Q: Sophia's baseball team had a combined score of 50 runs in the game. If Sophia hit for 28 runs and each of her teammates contributed 4 runs, how many players were on her team?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the number of players on Sophia's team, we start by determining how many runs were scored by her teammates. Sophia scored 28 runs, and the total score of the team was 50 runs. Therefore, the runs scored by teammates is calculated as follows: 50 runs (total) - 28 runs (Sophia) = 22 runs (teammates). Since each of her teammates contributed 4 runs, we divide the total runs scored by teammates by the runs per teammate: 22 runs / 4 runs per teammate = 5.5. As this cannot be correct since we can't have a fraction of a player, we should round down to the nearest whole number, which implies she actually has 5 teammates. Thus, the total number of players on her team would be Sophia plus her teammates, which is 1 (Sophia) + 5 (teammates) = 6 players in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: Aaron's football team celebrated victory in their game with a total score of 50 points.

The total score of the team is 45 points. To find out how many points were scored by the other players, we subtract Tom's points from the total score: 45 - 15 = 30 points. Each of the other players scored 5 points. To find out how many players scored those 30 points, we divide the total points scored by the other players by the points each one scored: 30 / 5 = 6 players. Including Tom, the total number of players on the team is 1 (Tom) + 6 (other players) = 7 players.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Michael's soccer team secured victory in their game, amassing a total of 56 points. If Michael scored 12 of those points while each of his teammates scored 4 points, how many players were on his team?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we establish the total points scored by Michael's team, which is 56 points. Michael individually scored 12 points, leaving the team points scored by his teammates as: 56 - 12 = 44 points. Each teammate scored 4 points. To find the number of teammates, we divide the total points scored by teammates by the points that each of them scored. This gives us: 44 points / 4 points per teammate = 11 teammates. Since the question asks for the total number of players on the team, we must include Michael as well, leading to: 11 teammates + 1 (Michael) = 12 players in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (12)\n\nQ: Isabella's hockey team tallied a total of 97 points during the season. If Isabella accounted for 45 points and each of her teammates scored 7 points, how many players were on the team?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nIsabella's hockey team scored a total of 97 points. Isabella scored 45 points herself. To find out how many points were scored by her teammates, we subtract Isabella's points from the total points: 97 - 45 = 52 points. Each of her teammates scored 7 points. To find the number of teammates, we divide the total points scored by her teammates by the points per teammate: 52 / 7 = 7.42857. Since we cannot have a fraction of a player, we round down to get 7 teammates. Including Isabella, the total number of players on the team is 7 + 1 = 8 players.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: Mark's volleyball team won their game with a score of 60 points. If Mark scored 25 points, and every other teammate scored 5 points each, how many players were on the team?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMark's volleyball team scored a total of 60 points. Mark scored 25 points. Therefore, the points scored by the teammates combined is 60 - 25 = 35 points. Each of the other teammates scored 5 points. Let the number of teammates be represented by 'x'. The total points scored by the teammates can be expressed as 5x = 35. To find the number of teammates, we solve for 'x': x = 35 / 5 = 7.

The café had 15 sandwiches ready and made 9 additional sandwiches. Therefore, the total number of sandwiches is 15 + 9 = 24 sandwiches. Next, we need to divide the total sandwiches equally among the 3 players. We do this by calculating 24 divided by 3, which gives us 8 sandwiches per player. Therefore, each player would get 8 sandwiches.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: A chef at 'The Hungry Chef' prepared meals for 60 diners. As more guests arrived, he added another 20 meals. If 45 diners were not satisfied with their food, how many diners were satisfied?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the chef prepared meals for 60 diners. After the arrival of more guests, he prepared an additional 20 meals, making the total number of meals prepared 60 + 20 = 80 meals. Out of the total diners, 45 diners were not satisfied with their food. To find out how many diners were satisfied, we subtract the dissatisfied diners from the total diners. Since the total number of diners is equal to the number of meals prepared (80), we calculate 80 - 45 = 35 diners satisfied with their food.\nTherefore, the answer is (35)\n\nQ: A concert was planned for 50 guests, but 20 of them couldn't make it. If the seating arrangement allows for 5 people per row, how many rows will they require?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we start with the total number of guests planned for the concert, which is 50. Since 20 guests couldn't make it, we need to subtract those from the total. This gives us 50 - 20 = 30 guests attending the concert. Next, we need to determine how many rows are required for these 30 guests, with each row accommodating 5 people. To find the number of rows needed, we divide the total number of attending guests by the number of guests per row: 30 / 5 = 6. Since 30 is evenly divisible by 5, we will need exactly 6 rows. Thus, the final answer is 6 rows.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: A team of 5 players came to a party. The host had 15 sandwiches prepared but made another 10 for them. If they shared them equally, how many sandwiches would each player get?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches prepared for the team. The host initially prepared 15 sandwiches and then made 10 more. To find the total, we add these two amounts together: 15 + 10 = 25 sandwiches in total. Next, we need to divide this total by the number of players, which is 5. So, we divide 25 by 5: 25 / 5 = 5. Therefore, each player would get 5 sandwiches.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: A restaurant reserved seats for 30 guests, but 5 were unable to make it. If each table can seat 6 diners, how many tables should they prepare?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many guests actually showed up to the restaurant. Since 5 out of the 30 reserved guests were unable to make it, we subtract 5 from 30. This gives us 30 - 5 = 25 guests who will be present. Next, we need to calculate how many tables are required to seat these 25 guests. Each table can seat 6 diners, so we divide the number of guests by the number of diners per table: 25 / 6 = 4.1667.

If 25 guests canceled, we subtract the canceled guests from the total invited guests: 100 - 25 = 75 guests remaining. Next, we need to determine how many tables are required for the remaining guests, with each table seating 12 guests. To find the number of tables, we divide the number of remaining guests by the number of seats per table: 75 / 12 = 6.25. Since we cannot have a fraction of a table, we round up to the nearest whole number, which means we need 7 tables to seat all the guests comfortably.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: During dinner service at 'The Golden Fork', a waiter managed 60 clients.

After throwing away 22 expired cans, the number of remaining cans is 60 - 22 = 38. She arranged these remaining cans by placing 6 cans on each shelf. To find out how many shelves were used, we divide the remaining cans by the number of cans per shelf, which is 38 / 6. This gives us approximately 6.33. Since she cannot use a fraction of a shelf, she would need a total of 7 shelves to accommodate all the cans.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: A library had 200 books. In one week they checked out 75 of them and placed the remaining ones on shelves with 10 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we start with 200 books in the library. During the week, 75 books were checked out. To find out how many books remain, we subtract the number of checked-out books from the total number of books: 200 - 75 = 125 books remaining. Next, we need to determine how many shelves are needed to hold the remaining books. Since there are 10 books on each shelf, we divide the remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 125 divided by 10 equals 12.5. Since we cannot have half a shelf, we round up to the nearest whole number, which means we will use 13 shelves to accommodate all the remaining books. Therefore, the number of shelves used is 13.\nTherefore, the answer is (13)\n\nQ: A stationery store had 8 packs of markers in stock before they received another shipment of 24 packs.

How many books could go on each of the smaller shelves?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmma had a total of 60 books. She placed 20 books on one shelf, leaving her with 60 - 20 = 40 books to distribute. She wants to distribute these 40 books into 8 equal shelves. To find out how many books can go on each shelf, we divide the remaining books by the number of shelves: 40 books ÷ 8 shelves = 5 books per shelf. Therefore, each of the smaller shelves can hold 5 books.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: A library had 40 books. On a special event they donated 15 of them and shelved the remaining books with 5 in each shelf. How many shelves did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the library had 40 books. After donating 15 books, the remaining books can be calculated as 40 - 15 = 25 books. If they shelve the remaining books with 5 books per shelf, we can find out the number of shelves needed by dividing the number of remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 25 ÷ 5 = 5 shelves. Therefore, they used 5 shelves to shelve the remaining books.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: A toy store had 50 action figures in stock. They ended up giving away 15 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 3 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe toy store initially had 50 action figures. They gave away 15, which means they now have 50 - 15 = 35 action figures left. They put these figures onto shelves, with 3 action figures on each shelf. To find out how many shelves they used, we divide the remaining action figures by the number of action figures per shelf: 35 ÷ 3 = 11 with a remainder of 2. Since we cannot have a partial shelf, we round down to 11 shelves used. However, the question asked is about the total number of shelves used, and since we have leftover action figures that cannot fill another shelf, the complete shelves used is 11. Therefore, the answer is (11).\nTherefore, the answer is (11)\n\nQuestion:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them.

If 30 of them did not make it to the next phase and the rest were categorized into 3 groups, how many programmers would be in each group?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine the total number of programmers who made it to the next phase by subtracting the number who did not make it from the total number of programmers. There were initially 90 programmers, and if 30 did not make it, we calculate the programmers who did make it: 90 - 30 = 60. Next, these 60 programmers are categorized into three groups. To find out how many are in each group, we divide the number of programmers who made it by the number of groups: 60 / 3 = 20. Therefore, there would be 20 programmers in each group.\nTherefore, the answer is (20)\n\nQ: There are 45 students entering a math competition. If 9 of them were not accepted, and the remaining students were arranged into 5 teams, how many students would be in each team?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we start with the total number of students entering the math competition, which is 45. Next, we need to determine how many students were accepted by subtracting the 9 students who were not accepted: 45 - 9 = 36. Now, we have 36 students who will be arranged into 5 teams. To find out how many students will be in each team, we divide the total number of students by the number of teams: 36 / 5 = 7.2. Since students cannot be in fractions, this means each team would have 7 students, and there will be some students left over. Specifically, after creating 5 teams of 7, that accounts for 35 students, leaving us with 1 student who cannot be allocated to a full team. Thus, not all teams will have the same number of members.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: There are 50 contestants competing in the school's science fair. If 20 of them didn't qualify for the next round and the remaining were divided into 5 teams, how many contestants would be in each team?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with 50 contestants in total. Out of these, 20 contestants did not qualify for the next round. Therefore, we need to find out how many contestants did qualify for the next round by subtracting those who didn't qualify from the total number of contestants: 50 - 20 = 30. Now that we have 30 contestants who qualified, we need to divide these contestants into 5 teams. To find out how many contestants will be in each team, we divide the number of qualified contestants by the number of teams: 30 / 5 = 6. Hence, each team will have 6 contestants.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: There are 40 participants in a coding challenge. If 8 of them were not selected to advance, and the others were assigned into 4 groups, how many participants would be in each group?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we start with a total of 40 participants. Out of these participants, 8 were not selected to advance. To find out how many participants are left who can be assigned to groups, we subtract the 8 non-selected participants from the total: 40 - 8 = 32 participants remaining. Now, these 32 participants need to be assigned into 4 groups. To find out how many participants will be in each group, we divide the remaining participants by the number of groups: 32 / 4 = 8 participants per group.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: In a local talent show, there are 80 performers. If 45 of them were not selected for the finals and the others were organized into 4 acts, how many performers would be in each act?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many performers were selected for the finals. Since there are 80 performers in total and 45 were not selected, we subtract 45 from 80 to find out how many were selected. \n\nCalculating this gives us: 80 - 45 = 35 performers were selected for the finals. \n\nNext, these 35 performers are organized into 4 acts. \n\nTo find out how many performers are in each act, we divide the number of performers selected by the number of acts: 35 / 4. \n\nCalculating this gives us: 35 / 4 = 8.75. Since we cannot have a fraction of a performer in each act, it's clear that the organization into 4 acts won’t yield whole numbers. Therefore, we look at it from an integer division perspective. Each act can get 8 performers and we would have 3 performers left over. \n\nThus, it's impractical to say how many would be in each act evenly without further specification about dealing with the remainder performers. However, the average per act would be 8 if we just distribute evenly without considering the leftover.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: At a corporate training day, 6 facilitators and 24 employees were divided into groups for activities. If they formed 4 teams, how many people would be in each team?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of people involved. We have 6 facilitators and 24 employees, which adds up to 6 + 24 = 30 people in total. Since we need to divide these 30 people into 4 teams, we will divide the total number of people by the number of teams: 30 ÷ 4 = 7.5. Since we can't have half a person, we have to consider that the teams cannot all have the same number of members if we want to keep them whole. It would make sense to have 7 people in three teams and 8 people in one team. Therefore, the distribution would be 3 teams of 7 members and 1 team of 8 members.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (7 or 8).)\n\nQ: In a spelling bee, there are 45 participants. If 18 of them did not advance to the finals and the remaining contestants were divided into 3 teams, how many contestants would be in each team?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nStart with the total number of participants, which is 45. Next, identify how many did not advance to the finals, which is 18. To find out how many contestants did advance, subtract those who did not advance from the total number of participants: 45 - 18 = 27. Now, to find out how many contestants are in each of the 3 teams, divide the number of contestants who advanced (27) by the number of teams (3): 27 / 3 = 9. Therefore, each team will have 9 contestants.\nTherefore, the answer is (9)\n\nQ: In a sports tryout, 68 athletes showed up.

If he had to collect 12 boxes from one room and 34 boxes from another, how many trips will he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of boxes James needs to collect. He needs to collect 12 boxes from one room and 34 boxes from another room. Adding these gives a total of 12 + 34 = 46 boxes. Next, since James can carry 7 boxes at a time, we need to determine how many trips he will have to make to collect all 46 boxes. To find this, divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes he can carry in one trip: 46 ÷ 7 = 6.57. Since James cannot make a fraction of a trip, we round this up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to make a total of 7 trips to collect all the boxes.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Alex was arranging his toy collection ensuring each of the boxes had precisely 5 toys in them. If he had 6 boxes of action figures and 4 boxes of building blocks, how many toys did he have in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of toys in the boxes of action figures. Since Alex has 6 boxes and each box contains 5 toys, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of toys per box: 6 boxes * 5 toys/box = 30 toys from action figures. Next, we do the same for the building blocks. Alex has 4 boxes of building blocks, and each also contains 5 toys, so we multiply: 4 boxes * 5 toys/box = 20 toys from building blocks. Finally, we add the number of toys from both categories to find the total number of toys. Total toys = 30 (action figures) + 20 (building blocks) = 50 toys.\nTherefore, the answer is (50)\n\nQ: For Christmas, Jack received 96 toy cars.

She originally has 72 items, and the manager takes 18 items. So we calculate the remaining items as follows: 72 - 18 = 54 items. Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to fit these 54 items, given that each box can hold 6 items. To find this, we divide the total number of items (54) by the number of items per box (6): 54 ÷ 6 = 9. Therefore, Samantha needs 9 boxes to organize the remaining items.\nTherefore, the answer is (9)\n\nQ: Sophia is at home arranging toys. There are 50 toys to put away total but a friend takes 12 of them and leaves Sophia with the rest. If she can fit 5 toys in a box, how many boxes will she need?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSophia starts with 50 toys. Her friend takes 12 toys, so the number of toys left with Sophia is 50 - 12 = 38 toys. To determine how many boxes she needs, we divide the number of toys by the capacity of each box. Since each box can hold 5 toys, we calculate 38 toys / 5 toys per box = 7.6. Since Sophia cannot use a fraction of a box, she will need to round up to the next whole number, which means she needs 8 boxes to fit all the toys.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: Tom wanted to grow his board game assortment.

Therefore, Ben needs 10 shelves to organize the remaining toys.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Samantha is at the art studio organizing canvases. There are 25 canvases to arrange in total, but an artist takes 5 of them and leaves Samantha with the rest. If she can fit 2 canvases on a shelf, how many shelves will she need?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we start with a total of 25 canvases. An artist takes 5 canvases, so we need to subtract that from the total: 25 - 5 = 20 canvases remain. Next, to determine how many shelves are needed if each shelf can hold 2 canvases, we divide the total number of remaining canvases by the number of canvases per shelf: 20 / 2 = 10 shelves. Therefore, Samantha will need 10 shelves to accommodate the remaining canvases.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Tom is at the storage room organizing boxes. There are 45 boxes to be arranged in total, but a co-worker takes 12 of them and leaves Tom with the rest. If he can fit 5 boxes on a shelf, how many shelves will he need?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTom starts with 45 boxes and his co-worker takes 12 of them. To find out how many boxes Tom has left, we subtract the number of boxes taken by his co-worker from the total boxes: 45 - 12 = 33 boxes. Next, we need to determine how many shelves are required to store these 33 boxes if each shelf can hold 5 boxes. We calculate this by dividing the number of remaining boxes by the number of boxes that fit on a shelf: 33 ÷ 5 = 6.6. Since Tom can't use a fraction of a shelf, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7. Therefore, Tom will need 7 shelves to organize the boxes.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: A library had 40 books. On a special event they donated 15 of them and shelved the remaining books with 5 in each shelf. How many shelves did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe library originally had 40 books. They donated 15 books, leaving them with 40 - 15 = 25 books. They decided to shelve the remaining 25 books with 5 books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves they used, we divide the number of remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 25 / 5 = 5 shelves. Therefore, the total number of shelves used is 5.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Tom was arranging his comic books in a case with 7 on each shelf. If he found 3 new comics and owned 21 old comics to store on the shelves, how many shelves would he require?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTom has 21 old comic books and he found 3 new ones. So, the total number of comic books he has is 21 + 3 = 24. Each shelf can hold 7 comic books. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the total number of comic books by the number of comic books per shelf: 24 ÷ 7 = 3.4286. Since he cannot have a fraction of a shelf, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, Tom will need 4 shelves to store all his comic books.\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQ: Mia is in the garage sorting out equipment. There are 70 equipment items to put away in total, but a neighbor takes 25 of them and leaves Mia with the rest. If she can fit 7 equipment items on a shelf, how many shelves will she need?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMia has a total of 70 equipment items initially. The neighbor takes 25 of them, so we need to calculate how many equipment items Mia has left. To find that, we subtract the 25 items taken by the neighbor from the total 70 items: 70 - 25 = 45 items left. Next, Mia can fit 7 equipment items on a shelf. We need to find out how many shelves she requires by dividing the number of items she has left by the capacity of each shelf: 45 ÷ 7 = 6.42857. Since she cannot have a fraction of a shelf, we round up to the next whole number, which is 7. Therefore, Mia will need 7 shelves to store the remaining equipment items.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Alex was assisting the library staff with returning books, but he could only carry 6 books at a time. If he needed to return 10 books from one shelf and 4 from another, how many trips will he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nAlex needs to return a total of 10 books from one shelf and 4 from another, which adds up to 14 books in total. Since he can carry 6 books at a time, we need to calculate how many trips it will take for him to return all 14 books. \n\n1. First, we calculate how many full trips Alex can make with 6 books: 14 books divided by 6 books per trip equals approximately 2.33 trips. \n2. Since he cannot make a partial trip, he will make 2 full trips. In these two trips, he will return 12 books (6 books in each of the 2 trips). \n3. After returning 12 books, there are still 2 books left (14 - 12 = 2). \n4. He will need to make an additional trip to return these remaining 2 books. \n5. Therefore, the total number of trips he will make is 2 full trips plus 1 additional trip, resulting in a total of 3 trips.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: Lisa is at the bookstore sorting through novels. There are 52 novels to organize in total, but a customer takes 10 of them and leaves Lisa with the rest. If she can fit 4 novels on a shelf, how many shelves will she need?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we start with 52 novels in total. After a customer takes 10 novels, we calculate the remaining novels. This is done by subtracting 10 from 52, giving us 42 novels remaining. Next, we need to determine how many shelves Lisa will need to organize these 42 novels, given that each shelf can hold 4 novels. We do this by dividing the number of novels by the capacity of one shelf: 42 novels ÷ 4 novels/shelf = 10.5 shelves. Since Lisa cannot use half a shelf, we round up to the next whole number, which gives us 11 shelves. Therefore, the answer is (11).\nTherefore, the answer is (11)\n\nQuestion:  Jerry is at the library helping put away books.

If he used 22 dollars to buy a new backpack, how many 8 dollar board games could he buy with the money he has left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nKevin earned a total of 60 dollars. He then spent 22 dollars on a new backpack. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the amount spent from his earnings: 60 dollars - 22 dollars = 38 dollars. Now, to determine how many 8 dollar board games he can buy with the remaining 38 dollars, we divide the remaining money by the price of one board game: 38 dollars ÷ 8 dollars per game = 4.75. Since he can only buy whole board games, he cannot buy 5 board games. Therefore, he can buy a maximum of 4 board games.\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQ: Michael launched his tutoring service. In the fall he earned 50 dollars tutoring students and in the winter he earned 70 dollars. If he had to spend 20 dollars on supplies, how much money did he end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate Michael's total earnings by adding the amounts he earned in the fall and winter. In the fall, he earned 50 dollars, and in the winter, he earned 70 dollars. So, total earnings = 50 + 70 = 120 dollars. Next, we need to account for the expenses on supplies, which amounted to 20 dollars. We subtract the expenses from the total earnings: 120 - 20 = 100 dollars. Therefore, the total amount of money Michael ended up with is 100 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (100)\n\nQ: A toy seller was selling action figures for 7 dollars each. If he started with 15 figures and by the end of the day he had 10 left, how much money did he earn?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe toy seller started with 15 action figures and sold some throughout the day. By the end of the day, he had 10 figures left. To find out how many figures he sold, we subtract the number of figures left from the initial number: 15 (initial) - 10 (left) = 5 figures sold. Each action figure was sold for 7 dollars. To find out how much money he earned from selling the action figures, we multiply the number of figures sold by the price per figure: 5 (sold) * 7 (price per figure) = 35 dollars earned. Therefore, the total earnings are 35 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (35)\n\nQ: Ben was selling his old video games at a garage sale. He sold 6 action games and 3 adventure games.

He sold 6 action games and 3 adventure games, which totals to 6 + 3 = 9 games. Next, since each game costs 10 dollars, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of games sold by the price per game. Therefore, 9 games × 10 dollars/game = 90 dollars. Thus, Ben earned a total of 90 dollars from selling his video games.\nTherefore, the answer is (90)\n\nQ: Ethan had 15 dollars. At the video game store he spent $7 on a game. If he was given another 5 dollars for doing chores, how much money does he have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEthan starts with 15 dollars. He spends 7 dollars on a game, which reduces his total to 15 - 7 = 8 dollars. After that, he earns an additional 5 dollars for doing chores, increasing his total to 8 + 5 = 13 dollars. Therefore, he has 13 dollars now.\nTherefore, the answer is (13)\n\nQuestion:  Oliver made 35 dollars mowing lawns over the summer.

There are 120 flowers to plant total but a neighbor takes 40 of them and leaves Karen with the rest. If she can fit 10 flowers in a row, how many rows will she need?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nKaren starts with a total of 120 flowers but loses 40 to her neighbor. So, we first calculate the number of flowers remaining: 120 - 40 = 80 flowers. Next, we know that Karen can fit 10 flowers in each row. To determine how many rows she will need, we divide the number of remaining flowers by the number of flowers per row: 80 flowers ÷ 10 flowers/row = 8 rows. Therefore, she will need 8 rows to plant the remaining flowers.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: Emma was supposed to plant 30 flowers and 10 trees in the garden. If she had only planted 25 of them by the time the sun set, how many did she not plant?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmma was supposed to plant a total of 30 flowers and 10 trees, which adds up to a total of 40 plants (30 + 10 = 40). If she only managed to plant 25 of them, we can find out how many she did not plant by subtracting the number she planted from the total number she was supposed to plant. Therefore, the calculation is 40 - 25 = 15. Hence, she did not plant 15 plants in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: Daniel was planting flowers in his backyard. He started with 36 bulbs and planted 16 of them in the main flowerbed, while in each of his side pots, he placed 3 bulbs each. How many side pots did Daniel have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nDaniel started with 36 bulbs and planted 16 in the main flowerbed. Therefore, the number of bulbs remaining after planting in the main flowerbed is 36 - 16 = 20 bulbs. Daniel then places 3 bulbs in each side pot. Let x be the number of side pots. The bulbs in the side pots can be represented as 3x. To find out how many side pots he had, we can set up the equation: 3x = 20. Solving for x, we divide both sides by 3, resulting in x = 20 / 3 which is approximately 6.67. Since Daniel cannot have a fraction of a pot, he has 6 complete side pots, which would utilize 18 bulbs, leaving 2 bulbs remaining, or he could also have chosen not to use the remaining pots, suggesting that effectively, the solution is indicative of no usable side pots given integer constraints.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: Michael had 50 flowers to plant in his yard. He decided to plant 20 of them in the main garden and put 5 flowers in each of his smaller flower beds. How many small flower beds did Michael create?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMichael planted 20 flowers in the main garden, leaving him with 50 - 20 = 30 flowers to use for his smaller flower beds. If he puts 5 flowers in each of the smaller flower beds, we need to determine how many small flower beds he can create with these remaining 30 flowers. To find this, we can divide the remaining flowers by the number of flowers he puts in each bed: 30 flowers / 5 flowers per bed = 6 beds. Therefore, Michael created 6 small flower beds.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: Emma was playing a farming game and had 45 vegetables. In a harvest that went wrong, she lost 18 vegetables. If she grew 22 more vegetables in the next season, how many vegetables would she have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmma initially had 45 vegetables. After losing 18 vegetables, we can calculate the remaining vegetables: 45 - 18 = 27. In the next season, she grew 22 more vegetables, so we add that to the remaining count: 27 + 22 = 49. Therefore, the total number of vegetables Emma has after the harvest and the new growth is 49.\nTherefore, the answer is (49)\n\nQ: Sara bought 70 packs of seeds for her herb garden.

To find how many points were scored by her teammates, we subtract Jessica's points from the total points: 78 - 18 = 60. Each of her teammates scored 8 points. To find out how many teammates there are, we divide the total points scored by her teammates (60) by the points each teammate scored (8): 60 / 8 = 7.5. This means there are a total of 7.5 teammates, which is not possible because the number of players must be a whole number.

Now, to determine how many jars can be filled with 9 biscuits each, we divide the remaining number of biscuits by 9: 45 / 9 = 5 jars. Therefore, Rachel can use 5 jars to pack the remaining biscuits.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Isabella had 36 cupcakes to serve. She placed 12 of them on one plate, but decided to split the other cupcakes into 3 equal trays. How many cupcakes could go in each tray?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nIsabella starts with 36 cupcakes. She puts 12 on one plate. To find out how many cupcakes are left, we subtract 12 from 36: 36 - 12 = 24. Now, she wants to split the remaining 24 cupcakes into 3 equal trays. To do this, we divide 24 by 3: 24 ÷ 3 = 8. Therefore, each tray will have 8 cupcakes.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: Maria baked 12 cupcakes and frosted 8 more for a party. If she organized the treats into 4 different trays with the same number of items in each tray, how many items were in each tray?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes that Maria baked and frosted. She baked 12 cupcakes and frosted 8 more, which amounts to a total of 12 + 8 = 20 cupcakes. Next, we want to organize these 20 cupcakes into 4 trays with the same number of items in each tray. To find out how many items are in each tray, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of trays: 20 cupcakes ÷ 4 trays = 5 cupcakes per tray. Therefore, there are 5 items in each tray.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: The bakery had 120 cupcakes. For an event, they gave away 45 cupcakes to guests and decided to use the remaining ones to create a special dessert. If each dessert requires 5 cupcakes, how many desserts could they make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe bakery started with 120 cupcakes. They gave away 45 cupcakes to guests. To find out how many cupcakes they have left, we subtract the number of cupcakes given away from the total. So, 120 - 45 = 75 cupcakes remaining. Next, we need to determine how many special desserts can be made using the remaining cupcakes. Each dessert requires 5 cupcakes. To find the number of desserts that can be made, we divide the number of remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes required for each dessert. Therefore, 75 cupcakes ÷ 5 cupcakes per dessert = 15 desserts. \nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQuestion:  Megan baked 71 cupcakes for her school's bake sale.

How many shelves did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe library started with 40 books and donated 15 of them. To find the number of books remaining, we subtract the donated books from the original total: 40 - 15 = 25 books remaining. Next, to find out how many shelves are needed to shelve the remaining books, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf: 25 books / 5 books per shelf = 5 shelves. Thus, they used 5 shelves to shelve the remaining books.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: A bookstore had 120 books. In one day, they sold 45 of them and organized the rest into shelves with 10 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with 120 books in the bookstore. They sold 45 books, so we subtract the number of books sold from the total: 120 - 45 = 75 books remaining. Now, we need to organize these remaining 75 books into shelves with 10 books each. To find out how many shelves are used, we divide the number of remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 75 / 10 = 7.5. Since we can only use whole shelves, we take the integer part of the result, which means they will use 7 shelves to hold the 70 books, leaving 5 books left over. Therefore, we can conclude that they used 7 shelves to organize the remaining books.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: A game store had 80 video games in stock.

She finished 15 of them but still had 3 chapters to read. If each chapter has the same number of pages, how many pages are in each chapter?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmily had 50 reading assignments and completed 15, leaving her with 50 - 15 = 35 assignments remaining. Since she still has 3 chapters to read, we can infer that the 35 assignments consist of 3 chapters. To find the number of pages in each chapter, we assume the 35 assignments are distributed evenly across the 3 chapters. Therefore, the number of pages in each chapter is calculated as follows: 35 assignments / 3 chapters = approximately 11.67 assignments per chapter. Since the context implies each chapter must consist of a whole number of pages, we consider the closest valid integer which would round the number of assignments in each chapter to either 11 or 12. However, in real execution, if we specifically want to find the number as whole pages, we can communicate that more detail about the assignments per chapter on average should be considered as pages consistently, thus leading to the whole integer results directly. Therefore, the final response could efficiently round to (12 assignments per chapter), based on the distribution of assignments.\nTherefore, the answer is (12)\n\nQ: Tom had 60 quiz questions. He answered 35 of them but still has 4 pages of questions to tackle. If each page has the same number of questions, how many questions are on each page?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTom had a total of 60 quiz questions. He successfully answered 35 of those questions. To find out how many questions still remain unanswered, we can subtract the number of answered questions from the total: 60 - 35 = 25. This means there are 25 questions left. Tom also has 4 pages of questions left to tackle. To find out how many questions are on each page, we take the total number of remaining questions (25) and divide that by the number of pages (4): 25 / 4 = 6.25. Since the number of questions per page needs to be a whole number, this means there cannot be a consistent whole number of questions per page given the current distribution of remaining questions. Therefore, since the question specifically asks for how many questions are on each page and given the fraction, the calculations show that there can't be a complete answer using the parameters provided.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (None).)\n\nQ: Emily bought four sticker albums. One had 12 pages, another had 25, and the last two had 15 each. After one week, she filled 35 pages with stickers.

She added 15 photos to one album and organized the rest into 4 separate albums. How many photos were in each album?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMia shared 50 photos on Snapchat. She added 15 photos to one album. First, we need to find out how many photos are left after adding the 15 to the album. This is done by subtracting 15 from 50, which gives us 35 photos remaining. Mia organized the rest of the 35 photos into 4 separate albums. To find out how many photos were in each of these albums, we need to divide the 35 photos by 4. Doing the division, we get 35 divided by 4, which equals 8.75 photos per album. Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a photo in this context, we interpret this as 8 photos in some albums and possibly 9 in others when considering how they might be distributed. However, based on the way the question is phrased, we are focused on the integer division result for a straightforward answer regarding an average or standard distribution. Thus, the calculated average of 8.75 reflects an estimation of the distribution of photos across the 4 albums.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (8.75).)\n\nQ: Laura sought to improve her music album collection.

She then divided these 80 images into 9 different albums. To find the number of images in each of the 9 albums, we divide the remaining images by 9. So, we calculate 80 images ÷ 9 albums = 8.888..., which we can consider as approximately 8.89 images per album (but since images must be whole numbers, this suggests not every album can contain the exact same number of images if they must be whole numbers). However, 8 of the albums can have 9 images each and 1 album can have 8 images. Thus the calculation is done indicating how the total number is split among the albums.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: Sophie was filing her photographs in an album with 3 on each page.

If each sale features 8 toys, how many sales could they have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe toy store started with 80 toys. They donated 12 toys to charity. To find out how many toys are left for the clearance sale, we need to subtract the donated toys from the total toys: 80 - 12 = 68. Now, we need to determine how many sales can be made if each sale features 8 toys. We can find this by dividing the remaining toys by the number of toys per sale: 68 / 8 = 8.5. Since they cannot have a fraction of a sale, they can only conduct 8 complete sales.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: A pet shop had 50 kittens. In a weekend they sold 14 of them and organized the rest into groups with 5 in each group. How many groups did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe pet shop originally had 50 kittens. After selling 14 kittens, the number of remaining kittens is calculated by subtracting 14 from 50. Thus, 50 - 14 = 36. Next, we need to determine how many groups can be formed with the remaining 36 kittens if each group contains 5 kittens. We find the number of groups by dividing 36 by 5. Performing the division, we get 36 ÷ 5 = 7.2. Since we can only have whole groups, we take the whole number of groups, which is 7. Therefore, they were able to organize 7 complete groups with 5 kittens each, leaving 1 kitten remaining. Hence, the total number of groups used is 7.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: A toy store had 90 teddy bears. In one day they sold 30 of them and organized the rest in display cases with 10 in each case. How many cases did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the toy store had 90 teddy bears. After selling 30 teddy bears, the number of teddy bears remaining is: 90 - 30 = 60. The store then organized the remaining 60 teddy bears in display cases with 10 in each case. To determine the number of cases used, we divide the remaining teddy bears by the number of teddy bears per case: 60 / 10 = 6. Therefore, they used a total of 6 display cases.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: A pet store had 8 aquariums set up when they got a new shipment with 32 aquariums. They arranged the aquariums on display with 4 on each display. How many displays did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe pet store initially had 8 aquariums and received 32 more, resulting in a total of 8 + 32 = 40 aquariums. To determine how many displays they used, we need to calculate how many sets of 4 aquariums fit into the total of 40 aquariums. Dividing the total number of aquariums by the number of aquariums per display gives us 40 / 4 = 10. Therefore, the pet store used 10 displays.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Tom was picking up cardboard for recycling. On the weekend he filled 8 crates and on the next day he filled 4 more crates. If each crate had 6 pieces of cardboard in it, how many pieces did he collect in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of crates filled by Tom. He filled 8 crates over the weekend and then filled 4 more crates the next day. Therefore, the total number of crates he filled is 8 + 4 = 12 crates. Next, we need to find out how many pieces of cardboard were in these crates. Each crate contained 6 pieces of cardboard. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the total number of crates (12) by the number of pieces per crate (6): 12 * 6 = 72 pieces.\nTherefore, the answer is (72)\n\nQ: A pet store had 70 fish tanks in stock. They ended up selling 20 of them. They placed the remaining tanks on display with 7 on each display. How many displays did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe pet store had 70 fish tanks and they sold 20 of them. To find out how many tanks remain, we subtract the number of tanks sold from the total number of tanks in stock. That's 70 - 20 = 50 tanks remaining. Next, we need to find out how many displays they used if they placed 7 tanks on each display. We divide the remaining number of tanks by the number of tanks per display: 50 / 7, which gives approximately 7.14. Since they can't use a fraction of a display, they would only use complete displays. Hence, they would need 8 displays in total to display all the tanks. Therefore, the answer is (8).\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: A pet shelter had 50 kittens. In one week they found homes for 20 of them and grouped the rest in cages with 5 in each cage.

To find out how many pieces of fabric she has left for smaller quilts, we subtract the pieces used for the large quilt from the total pieces. This gives us: 90 - 35 = 55 pieces remaining. Each smaller quilt uses 10 pieces. To find out how many smaller quilts Rachel can make, we divide the remaining pieces by the number of pieces needed for each smaller quilt: 55 / 10 = 5.5. Since she cannot make a fraction of a quilt, we round down to account for only complete quilts. Therefore, Rachel can make 5 smaller quilts in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Mark was assisting the construction workers in moving cement bags, but he could only carry 7 bags at a time.

We take the remaining problems, which is 70, and divide it by the number of topics, which is 10. Therefore, we calculate 70 / 10 = 7. Thus, there are 7 problems in each topic.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Sophia was assigned to read 50 pages of a book and complete 15 math exercises before her class. If she only read 20 pages by the time class started, how many pages and exercises did she not complete?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we identify the total number of pages Sophia was assigned to read, which is 50 pages. By the time class started, she only completed reading 20 pages. To find out how many pages she did not complete, we subtract the pages read from the total assigned pages: 50 - 20 = 30 pages unread. Next, Sophia was assigned to complete 15 math exercises, but we have no information indicating that she completed any of these exercises. Therefore, she did not complete 15 exercises. In total, the number of tasks she did not complete are 30 pages and 15 exercises. Therefore, she did not complete a total of 30 pages and 15 exercises.\nTherefore, the answer is ((30, 15))\n\nQ: Tina began with 63 writing tasks. She completed 10 but still has 3 pages of tasks remaining. If each page contains the same number of tasks, how many tasks are on each page?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTina started with 63 writing tasks. After completing 10 tasks, the remaining tasks are calculated as follows: 63 - 10 = 53 tasks remain. It is stated that Tina has 3 pages of tasks left, which means we need to find out how many tasks are on each page. To find this, we divide the remaining tasks by the number of pages: 53 tasks / 3 pages = 17.666... Since the number of tasks on a page must be a whole number, we conclude that this situation might involve an inconsistency or an approximation. However, following the arithmetic, each page has approximately 17.67 tasks, but we understand that tasks must be whole. Ultimately, if interpreted strictly for whole pages without overflow, we would say that each page must have 17 tasks, making the final steps important in defining output.\nTherefore, the answer is (17)\n\nQ: John has 72 math problems. He completed 15 of them but still has 5 pages of problems left. If each page contains the same number of problems, how many problems are on each page?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate how many math problems John has left after completing 15 of them. He started with 72 problems and completed 15, so we subtract 15 from 72: 72 - 15 = 57. This means he has 57 problems remaining. According to the problem, he still has 5 pages of problems left. To find out how many problems are on each page, we need to divide the total number of remaining problems by the number of pages: 57 problems / 5 pages = 11.4 problems per page. Since we are looking for the number of problems per page in whole numbers, John must have 11 problems on some pages and one page with 12 problems. However, the problem asks for how many problems are on each page, which should be an integer. Thus, the answer reflects the common scenario where we state the problems usually assigned per page.\nTherefore, the answer is (11)\n\nQ: Emily started with 90 reading assignments. After finishing 12, she found that she still had 6 pages left to read. If each page has an equal number of assignments, how many assignments are on each page?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmily started with a total of 90 reading assignments. After finishing 12 assignments, we can calculate how many assignments she has left: 90 - 12 = 78. She then found out that she still has 6 pages left to read. Therefore, the number of assignments that are remaining to be read is 78 - 6 = 72. Now, we need to find out how many assignments are on each page. Since she has 6 pages and 72 assignments left, we divide the total number of assignments by the number of pages: 72 assignments ÷ 6 pages = 12 assignments per page.\nTherefore, the answer is (12)\n\nQuestion:  Sarah had 55 homework problems.

", 'idx': 569, 'prompt': "Q: There are 100 kids trying out for the school play. If 20 of them did not make it, and the rest are sorted into 10 teams, how many kids would be in each team?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we start with 100 kids. If 20 of them did not make it, we subtract 20 from 100 to find the number of kids who successfully made it to the play. So, 100 - 20 = 80 kids made it. Next, we need to find out how many kids are in each of the 10 teams.

If 40 of them were not selected for the team and the remaining participants were split into 4 squads, how many athletes would be in each squad?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine how many athletes were selected for the team. Since there were 68 athletes in total and 40 were not selected, we subtract 40 from 68. This calculation gives us the number of selected athletes: 68 - 40 = 28. Next, we need to divide the 28 selected athletes into 4 squads. To find the number of athletes per squad, we divide 28 by 4: 28 / 4 = 7. Therefore, each squad consists of 7 athletes.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: There are 45 students entering a math competition. If 9 of them were not accepted, and the remaining students were arranged into 5 teams, how many students would be in each team?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many students were accepted into the competition. There were originally 45 students, and 9 of them were not accepted. We calculate the number of accepted students by subtracting the number of students not accepted from the total number of students: 45 - 9 = 36 accepted students. Next, we need to arrange these 36 students into 5 teams. To find out how many students are in each team, we divide the total number of accepted students by the number of teams: 36 / 5 = 7.2. Since the number of students per team must be a whole number, we note that it is not possible to evenly distribute all students into 5 teams, hence the teams cannot have an equal number of students without splitting.\nTherefore, the answer is (None)\n\nQ: There were 45 girls and 8 boys registering for the school's soccer team.

According to the problem, 18 participants did not advance to the finals. To find out how many contestants did advance, we subtract the number of participants who did not advance from the total participants: 45 - 18 = 27. Next, we know these 27 contestants are divided into 3 teams. To find out how many contestants are in each team, we divide the number of advancing contestants by the number of teams: 27 / 3 = 9.\nTherefore, the answer is (9)\n\nQ: There are 50 contestants competing in the school's science fair.

Out of these, 20 contestants did not qualify for the next round. To find the number of contestants who did qualify, we subtract the non-qualifying contestants from the total contestants: 50 - 20 = 30. Next, these 30 qualified contestants need to be divided into 5 teams. To find the number of contestants in each team, we divide the number of qualified contestants by the number of teams: 30 / 5 = 6. Therefore, there are 6 contestants in each team.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: At a coding competition, 90 programmers signed up.

{'question': " Haley baked 20 cupcakes for her school's bake sale. If her brother, Todd, ate 11 of them how many packages could she make if she put 3 cupcake in each package? ", 'idx': 573, 'prompt': "Q: The bakery had 120 cupcakes. For an event, they gave away 45 cupcakes to guests and decided to use the remaining ones to create a special dessert. If each dessert requires 5 cupcakes, how many desserts could they make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the bakery had 120 cupcakes. After giving away 45 cupcakes to guests, we need to calculate the remaining cupcakes. This is done by subtracting the number of cupcakes given away from the initial amount: 120 - 45 = 75. Next, we determine how many desserts can be made with the remaining cupcakes. Each dessert requires 5 cupcakes, so we divide the remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes needed for one dessert: 75 / 5 = 15. Therefore, the bakery can make 15 desserts.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: Isabella had 36 cupcakes to serve. She placed 12 of them on one plate, but decided to split the other cupcakes into 3 equal trays. How many cupcakes could go in each tray?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nIsabella initially had 36 cupcakes. She placed 12 cupcakes on one plate. To find out how many cupcakes are remaining after placing 12 on the plate, we subtract 12 from 36, which gives us 36 - 12 = 24 cupcakes left. Now, Isabella wants to split these 24 cupcakes into 3 equal trays. To find out how many cupcakes go into each tray, we divide the remaining cupcakes by the number of trays: 24 cupcakes ÷ 3 trays = 8 cupcakes per tray. Therefore, each tray can hold 8 cupcakes.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: A bakery had 150 cupcakes baked for the day. They sold 50 of them quickly. The cupcakes that were left were put on trays with 12 on each tray. How many trays did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe bakery initially baked 150 cupcakes. They sold 50 cupcakes, which means the number of cupcakes left is 150 - 50 = 100 cupcakes. Next, to determine how many trays they used, we need to divide the remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes that fit on each tray. There are 12 cupcakes per tray, so we calculate 100 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes per tray = 8.33 trays. Since they cannot use a fraction of a tray, they would use 8 complete trays and have some cupcakes left over. Therefore, technically, they used 8 trays. However, if we frame the question strictly about how many trays were utilized for the leftovers, they used trays in full, and no cupcakes can be left unpacked on a tray. Thus, functionally, they might use 9 trays to accommodate all cupcakes, with one tray not completely filled.\nTherefore, the answer is (9)\n\nQ: The bakery had 60 cupcakes. For an event, they sold 25 to customers and decided to use the rest to make a dessert. If each dessert takes 5 cupcakes, how many desserts could they make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine how many cupcakes are left after selling 25. Starting with 60 cupcakes, we subtract the 25 that were sold: 60 - 25 = 35 cupcakes remaining. Then, we need to find out how many desserts can be made from these 35 cupcakes, knowing that each dessert requires 5 cupcakes. We divide the remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes needed for one dessert: 35 / 5 = 7 desserts. Therefore, the bakery can make a total of 7 desserts from the remaining cupcakes.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Sophia baked 10 cupcakes and 30 cookies for a party.

If they each received the same amount, how many would each person get?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe family of 4 went to the bakery and found there were 12 cupcakes ready. The baker baked 16 more cupcakes. So, first we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes available for the family. This can be done by adding the initial 12 cupcakes with the additional 16 cupcakes baked. Therefore, Total Cupcakes = 12 + 16 = 28 cupcakes. Next, we need to divide the total number of cupcakes (28) by the number of family members (4) to determine how many cupcakes each person will get. Thus, Cupcakes per person = 28 / 4 = 7. Therefore, each person in the family will receive 7 cupcakes.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQuestion:  Haley baked 20 cupcakes for her school's bake sale.

In a weekend they sold 14 of them and organized the rest into groups with 5 in each group. How many groups did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe pet shop initially had 50 kittens. They sold 14 kittens during the weekend. To find out how many kittens are left, we subtract the sold kittens from the initial amount. 50 - 14 = 36 kittens remaining. Next, these 36 kittens are organized into groups of 5. To find the number of groups, we divide the remaining kittens by the group size: 36 / 5 = 7.2. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we only consider full groups. Therefore, we take the whole number part, which is 7 groups. However, since the problem asks how many groups they used, the practical answer remains 7 complete groups, with 1 kitten left over. Thus, they used 7 groups to organize the kittens.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Sarah was collecting plastic containers for recycling.

There are 52 novels to organize in total, but a customer takes 10 of them and leaves Lisa with the rest. If she can fit 4 novels on a shelf, how many shelves will she need?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLisa starts with 52 novels and a customer takes 10 of them. To find out how many novels Lisa has left, we subtract the number of novels taken by the customer from the total number of novels. So, 52 - 10 = 42 novels remain. Next, we need to determine how many shelves Lisa will need to store these 42 novels if each shelf can hold 4 novels. We do this by dividing the number of novels by the shelf capacity: 42 ÷ 4 = 10.5. Since Lisa cannot use half a shelf to store novels, we round up to the nearest whole number, which means she will need 11 shelves to accommodate all of her novels.\nTherefore, the answer is (11)\n\nQ: A library had 200 books. In one week they checked out 75 of them and placed the remaining ones on shelves with 10 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe library initially had 200 books. Out of these, 75 books were checked out. To find the number of books remaining in the library, we subtract the checked out books from the total number of books: 200 - 75 = 125. Now, these 125 books are to be placed on shelves with 10 books on each shelf. To determine how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 125 ÷ 10 = 12.5. Since we cannot have a partial shelf, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, we need 13 shelves to accommodate all the remaining books.\nTherefore, the answer is (13)\n\nQ: A toy store had 50 action figures in stock. They ended up giving away 15 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 3 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we start with 50 action figures in stock. They gave away 15 of them, so we need to subtract 15 from 50. This gives us 50 - 15 = 35 action figures remaining. Next, to determine how many shelves they can fill, we divide the number of remaining action figures (35) by the number of action figures per shelf (3). When we calculate 35 divided by 3, we get approximately 11.67. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf in practical terms, we can only use 11 full shelves. Thus, they would use 11 shelves for this arrangement.\nTherefore, the answer is (11)\n\nQ: Emma had 60 books to organize.

The restaurant needs a total of 25 tables and has already set up 8 tables. So, we subtract the number of tables set up from the total number of tables needed: 25 - 8 = 17 tables remaining to be set up. Next, we are informed that it takes 4 hours to set up each table. To find the total time required to set up the remaining 17 tables, we multiply the number of tables by the time taken per table: 17 tables * 4 hours/table = 68 hours. Thus, the total time required to set up the remaining tables is 68 hours.\nTherefore, the answer is (68)\n\nQ: A team of 3 players went to a café.

If the seating arrangement allows for 10 people per table, how many tables should they set up?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we start with the expected number of attendees, which is 50. Then, we subtract the number of cancellations (20) from this number. So, the attendees who will actually show up is 50 - 20 = 30. Next, we need to determine how many tables are required if each table accommodates 10 people. To find this, we divide the number of attendees by the number of seats per table: 30 attendees / 10 seats per table = 3 tables. Since we cannot have a fraction of a table, we round up to the next whole number, if necessary, but in this case, 3 is a whole number. Therefore, the number of tables that should be set up is 3.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQuestion:  A company invited 24 people to a luncheon, but 10 of them didn't show up.

If Jessica contributed 18 points and each of her teammates scored 8 points, how many players were on her team?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the number of players on Jessica's team, we can start by determining how many points the other players scored collectively. Jessica scored 18 points, so the points scored by her teammates is 78 - 18 = 60 points. Each of her teammates scored 8 points. To find the number of teammates, we divide the points scored by her teammates by the points each scored: 60 points ÷ 8 points/player = 7.5 players. Since the number of players must be a whole number, we need to consider that Jessica herself is part of the team. Therefore, the total number of players on the team is 7.5 + 1 = 8.5, which is not possible. Thus, we conclude that the setup suggests there are 7 teammates (whole number), and with Jessica included, there are 8 players on the team.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: Aaron's football team celebrated victory in their game with a total score of 50 points. If Aaron scored 10 points and the other players each scored 5 points, how many players were on his team?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know the total score of the team is 50 points. Aaron scored 10 points. Therefore, the total points scored by the other players is 50 - 10 = 40 points. Next, each of the other players scored 5 points. To find out how many other players there are, we divide the total points scored by the other players by the points scored by each player. This gives us 40 points / 5 points per player = 8 players. Including Aaron, the total number of players on the team is 8 + 1 = 9.\nTherefore, the answer is (9)\n\nQ: Sophia's basketball team achieved a total of 120 points in a game. If Sophia contributed 60 of those points and every other player scored 12 points each, how many players were there in total on her team?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSophia's team scored a total of 120 points. Sophia scored 60 points herself. To find out how many points were scored by the other players, we subtract Sophia's points from the total points: 120 - 60 = 60 points contributed by other players. Each of these players scored 12 points. To find the number of players, we divide the total points scored by the other players by the points each player scored: 60 / 12 = 5 players. Including Sophia, the total number of players on her team is 5 (other players) + 1 (Sophia) = 6 players.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: Isabella's hockey team tallied a total of 97 points during the season. If Isabella accounted for 45 points and each of her teammates scored 7 points, how many players were on the team?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know Isabella's hockey team scored a total of 97 points. Isabella contributed 45 points. To find out how many points were scored by her teammates, we subtract Isabella's points from the total: 97 - 45 = 52 points scored by teammates. Each of her teammates scored 7 points, so to find the number of teammates, we divide the total points scored by teammates by the points each teammate scored: 52 / 7 = 7.42857. Since we cannot have a fraction of a player, and the number of players must be a whole number, we round down to find that there were 7 teammates. Adding Isabella to the 7 teammates gives us a total of 8 players on the team.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: Mark's volleyball team won their game with a score of 60 points.

Mark scored 25 points, so we first subtract Mark's points from the total score: 60 - 25 = 35 points. The remaining points were scored by Mark's teammates, who scored 5 points each. To find out how many teammates there are, we divide the remaining points by the points each teammate scored: 35 / 5 = 7. Since Mark is also part of the team, we add him to the number of teammates: 7 + 1 = 8. Therefore, there are 8 players on the team in total.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: Emily's baseball team won the game, racking up a total of 72 points. If Emily scored 22 points and every other player added 6 points, how many players were on her team?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmily scored 22 points, and the total score of the team is 72 points. Subtracting Emily's points from the total gives us the points scored by the other players: 72 - 22 = 50 points. Each of the other players scored 6 points, so we can find the number of other players by dividing the total points scored by them by 6: 50 / 6 = 8.33. Since the number of players must be a whole number, we can't have a fractional player. Therefore, there can be no solution with the given conditions. Hence, there are no additional players to consider beyond Emily that satisfy the conditions.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQuestion:  Bianca's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total.

If she had to pick up 25 bricks from one pile and 7 bricks from another, how many trips will she make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmily can carry 8 bricks at a time. First, she needs to pick up 25 bricks from one pile. To determine the number of trips for the 25 bricks, we calculate the number of full loads she can carry: 25 ÷ 8 = 3 full trips (which accounts for 24 bricks), and she will have 1 brick remaining, which requires an additional trip. Thus, for the 25 bricks, she makes 4 trips. Next, she needs to pick up 7 bricks from another pile. 7 ÷ 8 = 0 full trips (as she can carry 8 bricks at once), meaning she can pick up all 7 bricks in just 1 trip. Therefore, adding both sets of trips together gives us 4 trips from the first pile and 1 trip from the second pile, totaling 5 trips overall.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: For a movie night, Jenny bought 5 bags of popcorn and 25 candy bars.

In one day they sold 18 of them and put the rest into boxes with 5 in each box. How many boxes did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we start with 75 action figures. After selling 18, we need to find out how many are left. We calculate this by subtracting the sold figures from the total: 75 - 18 = 57 action figures remaining. Then, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack these 57 action figures, with each box holding 5 figures. We perform the division: 57 ÷ 5 = 11.4. Since we cannot have a fraction of a box, we round this down to the nearest whole number, which means we can fill 11 boxes fully, and we will have some figures left over. However, the question asks how many boxes were used, and since there is a remainder, one more box would be needed to hold the leftover figures. So, we will actually need a total of 12 boxes.

If he had to pick up 32 boxes from one location and 9 from another, how many trips will he make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMichael needs to transport a total of boxes from two locations. First, we calculate the total number of boxes he has to pick up: 32 boxes from the first location and 9 boxes from the second location. This gives a total of 32 + 9 = 41 boxes. Since Michael can only carry 8 boxes at a time, we need to determine how many trips he will need to make to transport all 41 boxes. We calculate the number of trips by dividing the total number of boxes by the number of boxes he can carry per trip: 41 boxes / 8 boxes per trip = 5.125.

If each cupcake cost 2 dollars, how much money did she earn?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of cupcakes sold by adding the chocolate and vanilla cupcakes: 10 (chocolate) + 8 (vanilla) = 18 cupcakes. Next, multiply the total number of cupcakes sold by the price per cupcake: 18 cupcakes * 2 dollars per cupcake = 36 dollars. Thus, Sara earned a total of 36 dollars from selling her cupcakes.\nTherefore, the answer is (36)\n\nQ: The bakery had 60 cupcakes. For an event, they sold 25 to customers and decided to use the rest to make a dessert. If each dessert takes 5 cupcakes, how many desserts could they make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe bakery starts with 60 cupcakes. They sell 25 cupcakes. To find out how many cupcakes they have left, we subtract the number sold from the total: 60 - 25 = 35 cupcakes remaining. Each dessert requires 5 cupcakes. To determine how many desserts they can make, we divide the remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes needed for one dessert: 35 / 5 = 7 desserts. Therefore, the bakery can make 7 desserts.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: A bakery had 150 cupcakes in the display. They sold 65 of them during the day. The cupcakes left were arranged on trays with 8 cupcakes on each tray. How many trays did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 150 cupcakes. After selling 65, we need to determine how many cupcakes remain: 150 - 65 = 85 cupcakes left. Next, we arrange these remaining 85 cupcakes on trays, with each tray holding 8 cupcakes. To find out the number of trays used, we divide the number of remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per tray: 85 / 8 = 10.625. Since you can't have a fraction of a tray, we only count the whole trays used, which is 10. Therefore, the bakery used 10 trays and had some cupcakes left over.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: The bakery had 120 cupcakes. For an event, they gave away 45 cupcakes to guests and decided to use the remaining ones to create a special dessert. If each dessert requires 5 cupcakes, how many desserts could they make?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the bakery had 120 cupcakes. After giving away 45 cupcakes to guests, we can calculate the remaining cupcakes by subtracting 45 from 120. This gives us: 120 - 45 = 75 cupcakes remaining. Each dessert requires 5 cupcakes, so to find out how many desserts can be made, we divide the remaining cupcakes by the number of cupcakes needed for each dessert: 75 / 5 = 15 desserts. Therefore, they could make 15 desserts.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: A family of 4 went to a bakery. The baker had 12 cupcakes ready but baked 16 more for the family. If they each received the same amount, how many would each person get?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of cupcakes by adding the cupcakes that were already ready with those that were baked. The baker had 12 cupcakes ready and baked 16 more, so we have: 12 + 16 = 28 cupcakes. Next, we need to determine how many cupcakes each of the 4 family members would get if everyone received the same amount. To find this, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of family members: 28 cupcakes ÷ 4 family members = 7 cupcakes per person. Therefore, each person would get 7 cupcakes.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQuestion:  Sarah baked 38 cupcakes for her school's bake sale.

If 6 of the CDs were scratched, how many playable albums did she end up with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLaura initially bought 25 CDs from a friend. Then she added 4 more CDs during a sale. To find the total number of CDs she now has, we add 25 and 4. So, 25 + 4 equals 29. Next, we need to determine how many of these CDs are playable. It is given that 6 of the CDs were scratched, meaning they are not playable. To find the number of playable CDs, we subtract the scratched ones from the total. Therefore, 29 total CDs minus 6 scratched CDs equals 23 playable CDs.\nTherefore, the answer is (23)\n\nQ: Sophie was filing her photographs in an album with 3 on each page. If she had 10 new photos and 11 old photos to put in the album, how many pages would she use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSophie has a total of 10 new photos and 11 old photos, which sums up to 21 photos. Since she can place 3 photos on each page, we need to divide the total number of photos by the number of photos per page. To find out how many pages she would need, we calculate 21 photos divided by 3 photos per page, which is 21 / 3 = 7 pages. Therefore, she would need 7 pages to file all her photographs.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Sophia was filing her photo prints in an album with 3 on each page. If she had 2 new photos and 14 old photos to include in the album, how many pages would she fill?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine the total number of photos Sophia has by adding the new and old photos together. She has 2 new photos and 14 old photos. Therefore, the total number of photos is 2 + 14 = 16 photos. Since there are 3 photos per page in the album, we can find out how many pages she will need by dividing the total number of photos by the number of photos per page. 16 photos divided by 3 photos per page gives us 16 / 3 = 5.33. Since Sophia cannot fill a partial page, we round this up to the nearest whole number. Thus, she will need 6 pages to accommodate all the photos. Therefore, we conclude that she fills 6 pages of her album.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: On a recent vacation, Sarah took 60 photographs at the park and 5 at the restaurant.

First, we need to find the total number of albums she has now. We add the albums from both days: 4 + 5 = 9 albums. Each album contains 12 stamps, so to find the total number of stamps, we multiply the total number of albums by the number of stamps per album: 9 albums * 12 stamps/album = 108 stamps. Therefore, the total number of stamps is 108.\nTherefore, the answer is (108)\n\nQ: Jamie had 45 photos on her phone.
