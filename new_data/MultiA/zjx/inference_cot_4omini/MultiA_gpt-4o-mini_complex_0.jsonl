If a group of 13 people came in and 9 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "First, we need to identify how many adults are in the group. Since there are 13 people in total and 9 of them are kids, we can calculate the number of adults:\\n\\n13 total people - 9 kids = 4 adults.\\n\\nNext, we need to calculate the total cost for the adult meals. Each adult meal costs $7, so we multiply the number of adults by the cost of each meal:\\n\\n4 adults × $7/adult = $28.\\n\\nSince kids eat for free, the total cost for the group to eat will only include the adults' meals:\\n\\nThus, the total cost for the group to eat is $28.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is ($28.0).", 'true_answer': [28.0]}
