If each van can hold 9 people and there are 40 students and 14 adults going, how many vans will they need? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': 'First, we need to find out the total number of people going on the field trip. There are 40 students and 14 adults, so the total is:\\n\\n40 + 14 = 54 people.\\n\\nNext, we need to determine how many vans are required to transport all 54 people, knowing that each van can hold 9 people. We calculate the number of vans needed by dividing the total number of people by the capacity of each van:\\n\\n54 ÷ 9 = 6 vans.\\n\\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a van, we round up if necessary. However, in this case, 54 is evenly divisible by 9.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is (6.0) vans.', 'true_answer': [6.0]}

If Emily scored 23 of the points and everyone else scored 2 points each, how many players were on her team? \nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': "First, we know that Emily's team scored a total of 39 points. Emily herself scored 23 points. To find out how many points were scored by the other players, we subtract Emily's points from the total points:\\n\\n39 - 23 = 16 points.\\n\\nNow, we know that each of the other players scored 2 points each. To find the number of other players, we divide the points scored by the other players by the points each player scored:\\n\\n16 / 2 = 8 players.\\n\\nNow, we must include Emily in the total count of players on the team. Therefore, the total number of players on her team is:\\n\\n8 (other players) + 1 (Emily) = 9 players.\\n\\nThus, the answer is (9.0).", 'true_answer': [8.0]}
