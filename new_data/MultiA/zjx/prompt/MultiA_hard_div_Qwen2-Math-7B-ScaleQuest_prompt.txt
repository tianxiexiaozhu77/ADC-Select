Q:  Oliver is at the library helping put away books. There are 46 book to put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with the rest. If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To determine how many shelves Oliver will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of books Oliver has to put away:**
   The total number of books is 46, and the librarian takes 10 of them. So, the number of books Oliver has to put away is:
   \[
   46 - 10 = 36
   \]

2. **Determine how many shelves are needed:**
   Oliver can fit 4 books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves he needs, we divide the number of books by the number of books per shelf:
   \[
   \frac{36}{4} = 9
   \]
   Since 36 divided by 4 is exactly 9, Oliver will need 9 shelves to put away all the books.
Therefore, the number of shelves Oliver will need is \(\boxed{9}\). output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9 output: 9.


Q:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To determine how many shelves the store used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of coloring books remaining after the sale:**
   The store initially had 40 coloring books and sold 20 of them.
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20
   \]
   So, the store has 20 coloring books left.

2. **Determine how many shelves are needed to store the remaining coloring books:**
   The store puts 4 coloring books on each shelf. To find out how many shelves are needed, we divide the number of remaining coloring books by the number of coloring books per shelf.
   \[
   \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]
   So, the store used 5 shelves.
Therefore, the number of shelves the store used is \(\boxed{5}\).


Q:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To determine how many boxes Edward had to use, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of games Edward has left after selling some:**
   Edward started with 35 games and sold 19 of them.
   \[
   35 - 19 = 16
   \]
   So, Edward has 16 games left.

2. **Determine how many boxes are needed to pack the remaining games:**
   Edward packs the remaining 16 games into boxes, with each box containing 8 games.
   To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games per box:
   \[
   16 \div 8 = 2
   \]
   So, Edward needs 2 boxes to pack all the remaining games.
Therefore, the number of boxes Edward had to use is \(\boxed{2}\).


Q:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To determine how much Haley spent on tickets, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tickets Haley bought.
2. Determine the cost of these tickets.

First, let's find the total number of tickets Haley bought. She bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets. So, the total number of tickets is:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of these tickets. Each ticket costs $4. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]
So, Haley spent \(\boxed{32}\) dollars on tickets.


Q:  Edward bought 79 tickets at the state fair. He spent 23 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth and decided to use the rest on rides. If each ride cost 7 tickets, how many rides could he go on? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To determine how many rides Edward can go on, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tickets Edward has left after spending some at the 'dunk a clown' booth:**
   Edward initially bought 79 tickets and spent 23 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth.
   \[
   79 - 23 = 56
   \]
   So, Edward has 56 tickets left.

2. **Determine how many rides Edward can go on with the remaining tickets:**
   Each ride costs 7 tickets. To find out how many rides Edward can go on, we divide the number of remaining tickets by the cost per ride.
   \[
   56 \div 7 = 8
   \]
   So, Edward can go on 8 rides.

Therefore, the number of rides Edward can go on is \(\boxed{8}\).
However, the problem statement asks for the number of rides Edward could go on, and the answer is \(\boxed{8}\), not \(\boxed{0}\) as initially stated. The correct answer is \(\boxed{8}\).


Q:  Ned was trying to expand his game collection. He bought 11 games from a friend and bought 22 more at a garage sale. If 19 of the games didn't work, how many good games did he end up with? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To determine how many good games Ned ended up with, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of games Ned bought.
2. Subtract the number of games that didn't work from the total number of games bought.

First, let's find the total number of games Ned bought. He bought 11 games from a friend and 22 more at a garage sale. So, the total number of games is:
\[ 11 + 22 = 33 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these games worked. We know that 19 of the games didn't work. Therefore, the number of good games is the total number of games minus the number of games that didn't work:
\[ 33 - 19 = 14 \]

So, the number of good games Ned ended up with is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]

However, the problem statement seems to have a different interpretation. It states "If 19 of the games didn't work, how many good games did he end up with?" The answer to this interpretation is that Ned ended up with no good games because the problem implies that all the games he bought were defective. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement to ensure we understand it correctly.

If the problem is asking how many good games Ned ended up with after buying 33 games and 19 of them didn't work, then the number of good games is:
\[ 33 - 19 = 14 \]

But if the problem is asking how many good games Ned ended up with after buying 11 games from a friend and 22 more at a garage sale, and then finding out that 19 of the games didn't work, then the number of good games is:
\[ 11 + 22 - 19 = 14 \]
In both interpretations, the number of good games is the same. Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \].


Q:  George was working as a sacker at a grocery store where he made 5 dollars an hour. On Monday he worked 7 hours and on Tuesday he worked 2 hours. How much money did George make in those two days? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To determine how much money George made in those two days, we need to calculate his earnings for each day and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate George's earnings for Monday:
- George worked 7 hours on Monday.
- He makes $5 per hour.
- Therefore, his earnings for Monday are:
  \[
  7 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 35 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate George's earnings for Tuesday:
- George worked 2 hours on Tuesday.
- He makes $5 per hour.
- Therefore, his earnings for Tuesday are:
  \[
  2 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 10 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we sum up the earnings from both days to find the total amount of money George made:
\[
35 \text{ dollars} + 10 \text{ dollars} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]
Thus, the total amount of money George made in those two days is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\].


Q:  A group of 4 friends went into a restaurant. The chef already had 9 chicken wings cooked but cooked 7 more for the group. If they each got the same amount how many would each person get? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To determine how many chicken wings each of the 4 friends would get, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of chicken wings:**
   The chef initially had 9 chicken wings and cooked 7 more. Therefore, the total number of chicken wings is:
   \[
   9 + 7 = 16
   \]

2. **Divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of friends:**
   There are 4 friends, and they will share the 16 chicken wings equally. So, we divide 16 by 4:
   \[
   16 \div 4 = 4
   \]

Thus, each friend will get 4 chicken wings. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]

In a certain town, there are 100 houses numbered from 1 to 100. Each house has a unique number of pets, ranging from 0 to 99. The sum of the number of pets in all the houses is 4950. If the house numbered 50 has 49 pets, determine the number of pets in the house numbered 1.
To determine the number of pets in the house numbered 1, we start by defining the number of pets in each house. Let \( p_i \) be the number of pets in the house numbered \( i \). We know the following:

1. The sum of the number of pets in all the houses is 4950.
2. The house numbered 50 has 49 pets, so \( p_{50} = 49 \).

We can express the sum of the number of pets as:
\[ p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + \cdots + p_{100} = 4950. \]

We need to find \( p_1 \). To do this, we will use the fact that the number of pets in each house is a unique integer from 0 to 99. The sum of the first 99 positive integers is:
\[ 0 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + 98 + 99 = \frac{99 \cdot 100}{2} = 4950. \]

This means that if each house had a unique number of pets from 0 to 99, the total number of pets would be 4950. However, since the house numbered 50 has 49 pets instead of 49, the number of pets in the house numbered 1 must be adjusted accordingly. If the house numbered 50 had the number 49, the sum of the pets would be 4950. But since it has 49 pets, the sum of the pets is still 4950, which means the number of pets in the house numbered 1 must be 0.

To verify, if the house numbered 50 has 49 pets, then the number of pets in the house numbered 1 must be 0 to maintain the sum of 4950. Therefore, the number of pets in the house numbered 1 is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]

In a math competition, a problem involves a sequence of numbers where each term is the sum of the squares of the digits of the previous term. Starting with the number 23, the sequence is generated as follows: the first term is 23, the second term is $2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13$, the third term is $1^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 9 = 10$, and the fourth term is $1^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 0 = 1$. The sequence continues with the fifth term being $1^2 = 1$, and so on. Determine the number of terms in the sequence before it reaches the number 1 and stays there.
To determine the number of terms in the sequence before it reaches the number 1 and stays there, we will follow the sequence step by step, calculating each term until we reach 1.

1. The first term is 23.
2. The second term is $2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13$.
3. The third term is $1^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 9 = 10$.
4. The fourth term is $1^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 0 = 1$.
5. The fifth term is $1^2 = 1$.
6. The sixth term is $1^2 = 1$.
From the fourth term onwards, the sequence stays at 1. Therefore, the sequence reaches.
