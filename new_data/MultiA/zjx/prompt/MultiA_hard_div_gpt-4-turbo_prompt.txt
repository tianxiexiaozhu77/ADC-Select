Q:  Oliver is at the library helping put away books. There are 46 book to put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with the rest. If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
Initially, there are 46 books to be shelved. A librarian takes 10 books, leaving Oliver with 36 books to shelve. The capacity of each shelf is 4 books. To find out how many shelves Oliver needs, divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold: 36 books / 4 books per shelf = 9 shelves. Therefore, Oliver will need 9 shelves to fit all the books.
Therefore, the answer is (9).


Q:  A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
The store initially had 40 coloring books. After putting 20 of them on sale, they were left with 40 - 20 = 20 coloring books. These remaining 20 books were then organized onto shelves with 4 books each. To find out how many shelves were used, we divide the total number of remaining books by the number of books per shelf: 20 / 4 = 5. Therefore, 5 shelves were used to store the remaining books.
Therefore, the answer is (5).


Q:  Edward was selling his old games. He started out with 35 but sold 19 of them. He packed the rest up putting 8 games into each box. How many boxes did he have to use? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
Edward initially had 35 games and sold 19 of them. To find out how many games are left, we subtract the number of games sold from the total number of games he originally had, which is 35 - 19 = 16 games. Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to pack these remaining games, with each box holding 8 games. To find this, we divide the number of remaining games by the number of games each box can hold, which is 16 / 8 = 2. Therefore, Edward needs to use 2 boxes to pack the remaining games.
Therefore, the answer is (2).


Q:  Haley's favorite band was holding a concert where tickets were 4 dollars each. Haley bought 3 tickets for herself and her friends and 5 extra tickets in case anyone else wanted to go. How much did she spend? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
First, calculate the total number of tickets Haley purchased by adding the 3 tickets she bought for herself and her friends to the 5 extra tickets, which gives 3 + 5 = 8 tickets. Next, determine the total cost by multiplying the number of tickets (8) by the cost per ticket (4 dollars), which results in 8 * 4 = 32 dollars. Therefore, Haley spent a total of 32 dollars on tickets.
Therefore, the answer is (32).


Q:  Edward bought 79 tickets at the state fair. He spent 23 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth and decided to use the rest on rides. If each ride cost 7 tickets, how many rides could he go on? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
First, Edward started with 79 tickets. He used 23 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth, leaving him with 79 - 23 = 56 tickets. Each ride costs 7 tickets. To find out how many rides he could go on, we divide the remaining tickets by the cost per ride: 56 tickets / 7 tickets per ride = 8 rides. Therefore, Edward could go on 8 rides.
Therefore, the answer is (8).


Q:  Ned was trying to expand his game collection. He bought 11 games from a friend and bought 22 more at a garage sale. If 19 of the games didn't work, how many good games did he end up with? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
First, calculate the total number of games Ned bought by adding the games he bought from a friend and the ones from the garage sale. This gives 11 (from friend) + 22 (from garage sale) = 33 games. Next, it's noted that 19 of these games did not work. To find out how many games did work, subtract the non-working games from the total number of games: 33 total - 19 not working = 14 games that work. Therefore, Ned ended up with 14 good games.
Therefore, the answer is (14).


Q:  George was working as a sacker at a grocery store where he made 5 dollars an hour. On Monday he worked 7 hours and on Tuesday he worked 2 hours. How much money did George make in those two days? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
To calculate how much money George made in those two days, first calculate his earnings for each day by multiplying the number of hours he worked by his hourly wage. On Monday, George worked 7 hours at a rate of 5 dollars per hour. So, the earnings for Monday are calculated as follows: 7 hours * 5 dollars/hour = 35 dollars. On Tuesday, he worked 2 hours also at the same rate of 5 dollars per hour. The earnings for Tuesday are calculated as follows: 2 hours * 5 dollars/hour = 10 dollars. To find the total earnings for both days, add the earnings from Monday and Tuesday together: 35 dollars + 10 dollars = 45 dollars.
Therefore, the answer is (45).


Q:  A group of 4 friends went into a restaurant. The chef already had 9 chicken wings cooked but cooked 7 more for the group. If they each got the same amount how many would each person get? 
A: Let's think step by step. 
First, we determine the total number of chicken wings available after the chef cooks additional wings. Initially, there are 9 wings, and the chef cooks 7 more, giving a total of 9 + 7 = 16 wings. Next, we divide the total number of wings by the number of friends to find out how many wings each person gets. There are 4 friends, so each friend gets 16 / 4 = 4 wings.
Therefore, the answer is (4).
