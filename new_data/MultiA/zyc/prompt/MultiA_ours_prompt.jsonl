If each player had 8 lives, how many lives did they have total? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, the two friends had 8 lives each, which equals 16 lives. Then, when 2 more players joined with 8 lives each, that adds another 16 lives. Therefore, the total number of lives is 32.\nTherefore, the answer is (32.0)\n\n\nQ:  There were 7 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 7 lives, how many lives did they have total? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere were 7 friends with 7 lives each, so the total lives before the new players joined was 7 x 7 = 49. When 2 more players joined, that's an additional 2 x 7 = 14 lives. Adding these together gives a total of 49 + 14 = 63 lives.\nTherefore, the answer is (63.0)\n\n\nQ:  There were 13 friends playing a video game online when 8 players quit. If each player left had 6 lives, how many lives did they have total? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere were 13 friends playing the video game with 6 lives each, so the total lives they had originally was 13 * 6 = 78. When 8 players quit, they took their 6 lives each with them, which is a total of 8 * 6 = 48 lives. Therefore, the remaining players have a total of 78 - 48 = 30 lives.\nTherefore, the answer is (30.0)\n\n\nQ:  John was trying to expand his game collection.

So the total time needed to paint all rooms is 12 * 7 = 84 hours. He has already painted 5 rooms, so he has 12 - 5 = 7 rooms left to paint. To find out how much longer it will take him to paint the rest, we need to multiply the remaining number of rooms by the time it takes to paint one room: 7 * 7 = 49 hours.\nTherefore, the answer is (49.0)\n\n\nQ:  A painter needed to paint 11 rooms in a building. Each room takes 7 hours to paint. If he already painted 2 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe painter needs to paint 11 rooms, and each room takes 7 hours to paint. So, the total time needed to paint all the rooms is 11 * 7 = 77 hours. If he has already painted 2 rooms, then he has completed 2 * 7 = 14 hours of work.

Each room takes 5 hours to paint. If he already painted 2 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe painter has already painted 2 out of 6 rooms, so he still needs to paint 4 rooms. Each room takes 5 hours to paint, so the remaining time needed is 4 rooms * 5 hours/room = 20 hours.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\n\nQ:  A painter needed to paint 12 rooms in a building. Each room takes 3 hours to paint. If he already painted 4 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe painter has already painted 4 out of the 12 rooms, so he still needs to paint 12 - 4 = 8 rooms. Each room takes 3 hours to paint, so the total time needed to paint the remaining rooms is 8 * 3 = 24 hours.\nTherefore, the answer is (24.0)\n\n\nQ:  A painter needed to paint 10 rooms in a building. Each room takes 8 hours to paint. If he already painted 8 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe painter has already painted 8 rooms, which means he has completed 8 * 8 = 64 hours of work. He still needs to paint 10 - 8 = 2 rooms. Each room takes 8 hours to paint, so he will need an additional 2 * 8 = 16 hours to finish painting the rest.\nTherefore, the answer is (16.0)\n\n\nQ:  Edward was working as a sacker at a grocery store where he made 6 dollars an hour. On Monday he worked 3 hours and on Tuesday he worked 5 hours.

If he had 14 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 8 of them, how much money did he actually earn? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nRoger earned 9 dollars for each lawn he mowed. He had 14 lawns to mow, so he would have earned 9 * 14 = 126 dollars if he mowed all of them. However, he forgot to mow 8 lawns, so the amount of money he actually earned is 9 * (14 - 8) = 9 * 6 = 54 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (54.0)\n\n\nQ:  Adam earned 9 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 12 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 8 of them, how much money did he actually earn? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nAdam was supposed to mow 12 lawns, earning 9 dollars for each one, so the total earnings would have been 12 * 9 = 108 dollars.

Therefore, the actual amount earned is 4 * 9 = 36 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (36.0)\n\n\nQ:  Edward earned 4 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 17 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 9 of them, how much money did he actually earn? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we find the total amount of money Edward could have earned by mowing all 17 lawns: 4 dollars/lawn * 17 lawns = 68 dollars. Then we subtract the amount he missed out on by forgetting to mow 9 lawns: 4 dollars/lawn * 9 lawns = 36 dollars. Therefore, the actual amount of money Edward earned is: 68 dollars - 36 dollars = 32 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (32.0)\n\n\nQ:  Edward earned 9 dollars for each lawn he mowed.

{"idx": 455, "prompt": "Q:  There were 5 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 8 lives, how many lives did they have total? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere were initially 5 friends with 8 lives each, so the total lives was 5 * 8 = 40. When 2 more players joined, the total number of players became 5 + 2 = 7. Each player still had 8 lives, so the total lives became 7 * 8 = 56.\nTherefore, the answer is (56.0)\n\n\nQ:  There were 8 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 6 lives, how many lives did they have total? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the initial total lives by multiplying the number of players (8) by the number of lives each player has (6), which equals 48. Then, add the additional lives from the 2 new players joining, which is 2 multiplied by 6, equaling 12. Finally, add the initial total lives to the additional lives to get the final total: 48 + 12 = 60.\nTherefore, the answer is (60.0)\n\n\nQ:  There were 4 friends playing a video game online when 5 more players joined the game. If each player had 3 lives, how many lives did they have total? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of players before the new players joined: 4 friends. Then, we add the 5 new players that joined, totaling 9 players. Next, we multiply the total number of players by the number of lives each player has (9 * 3 = 27).\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\n\nQ:  There were 16 friends playing a video game online when 7 players quit. If each player left had 8 lives, how many lives did they have total? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere were initially 16 friends playing the video game, and 7 of them quit, leaving 9 players remaining. Since each player left had 8 lives, we can calculate the total number of lives by multiplying the number of players by the number of lives each player had (9 players * 8 lives/player = 72 total lives).\nTherefore, the answer is (72.0)\n\n\nQ:  There were 7 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 7 lives, how many lives did they have total? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere were 7 friends with 7 lives each, so the total lives before the new players joined was 7 x 7 = 49. When 2 more players joined, that's an additional 2 x 7 = 14 lives. Adding these together gives a total of 49 + 14 = 63 lives.\nTherefore, the answer is (63.0)\n\n\nQ:  There were 2 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 8 lives, how many lives did they have total? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, the two friends had 8 lives each, which equals 16 lives. Then, when 2 more players joined with 8 lives each, that adds another 16 lives. Therefore, the total number of lives is 32.\nTherefore, the answer is (32.0)\n\n\nQ:  There were 13 friends playing a video game online when 8 players quit. If each player left had 6 lives, how many lives did they have total? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere were 13 friends playing the video game with 6 lives each, so the total lives they had originally was 13 * 6 = 78. When 8 players quit, they took their 6 lives each with them, which is a total of 8 * 6 = 48 lives. Therefore, the remaining players have a total of 78 - 48 = 30 lives.\nTherefore, the answer is (30.0)\n\n\nQ:  There were 2 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 6 lives, how many lives did they have total? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of players by adding 2 friends and 2 more players, which equals 4.

This means he still needs to install 14 - 5 = 9 windows. If it takes 4 hours to install each window, then the total time needed to install the remaining windows is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.\nTherefore, the answer is (36.0)\n\n\nQ:  A new building needed 10 windows. The builder had already installed 6 of them. If it takes 5 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe builder needs to install 10 windows in total, and has already installed 6. This means he still needs to install 4 windows. Since it takes 5 hours to install each window, the total time needed to install the remaining windows is 4 * 5 = 20 hours.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\n\nQ:  A new building needed 9 windows. The builder had already installed 6 of them. If it takes 6 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe builder has already installed 6 windows, so he needs to install 9 - 6 = 3 more windows. If it takes 6 hours to install each window, then the total time needed to install the remaining windows is 3 * 6 = 18 hours.\nTherefore, the answer is (18.0)\n\n\nQ:  A new building needed 14 windows. The builder had already installed 8 of them. If it takes 8 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many windows are left to install by subtracting the number of windows already installed from the total needed: 14 - 8 = 6. Then, we can calculate the total time it will take to install the remaining windows by multiplying the number of windows left to install by the time it takes to install each window: 6 * 8 = 48 hours.\nTherefore, the answer is (48.0)\n\n\nQ:  A pet shelter had 9 puppies when another 12 were brought in.

If he had 17 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 9 of them, how much money did he actually earn? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we find the total amount of money Edward could have earned by mowing all 17 lawns: 4 dollars/lawn * 17 lawns = 68 dollars. Then we subtract the amount he missed out on by forgetting to mow 9 lawns: 4 dollars/lawn * 9 lawns = 36 dollars. Therefore, the actual amount of money Edward earned is: 68 dollars - 36 dollars = 32 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (32.0)\n\n\nQ:  Adam earned 9 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 12 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 8 of them, how much money did he actually earn? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nAdam was supposed to mow 12 lawns, earning 9 dollars for each one, so the total earnings would have been 12 * 9 = 108 dollars.

Therefore, to find out how much money he actually earned, we need to calculate 8 dollars multiplied by the number of lawns he mowed. John had 15 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 7 of them. So, he actually mowed 15 - 7 = 8 lawns. Therefore, the amount of money John earned is 8 lawns * 8 dollars per lawn = 64 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (64.0)\n\n\nQ:  Roger earned 9 dollars for each lawn he mowed. If he had 14 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 8 of them, how much money did he actually earn? \nA: Let's think step by step. \nRoger earned 9 dollars for each lawn he mowed. He had 14 lawns to mow, so he would have earned 9 * 14 = 126 dollars if he mowed all of them.
