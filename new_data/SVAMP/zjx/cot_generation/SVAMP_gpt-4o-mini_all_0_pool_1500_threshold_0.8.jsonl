{"question": "Ryan was collecting coins for his collection. On Friday he had 3 jars of coins. The next day he got some more jars of coins. If he had a total of 5 jars altogether, how many jars did he get on the next day?", "cot": "Initially, Ryan had 3 jars of coins. After the next day, he had a total of 5 jars. To find out how many jars he got the next day, we subtract the initial number of jars from the total number of jars he has after the next day. So, we calculate 5 jars (total) - 3 jars (initial) = 2 jars. Therefore, Ryan received 2 additional jars the next day.", "answer": "2", "score": 5.016195203217914}
{"question": "Tom was setting up a barbecue for his friends. Each pack of drinks he purchased had 8 cans in it and he bought 2 packs. If he wants to provide drinks for 45 people, how many extra cans will he need to buy?", "cot": "First, calculate the total number of cans Tom purchased. Each pack contains 8 cans and he bought 2 packs, so he has 8 * 2 = 16 cans. Next, calculate how many cans are needed for 45 people. Assuming each person gets 1 can, Tom needs 45 cans. Now, determine how many extra cans he needs by subtracting the number of cans he has from the number of cans needed: 45 - 16 = 29. Therefore, the additional cans that Tom needs to buy are 29.", "answer": "29", "score": 5.479451708594882}
{"question": "Michael collects coins. He discarded 50 of the old coins during a trip while he picked up 45 new coins. Now he has 85 coins in his collection. How many coins did Michael have at first?", "cot": "Let x be the number of coins Michael had at first. During the trip, he discarded 50 coins and picked up 45 new coins. Therefore, his total number of coins after these actions can be represented as x - 50 + 45. Simplifying this gives us x - 5. According to the problem, after these actions, Michael has 85 coins. We can set up the equation: x - 5 = 85. By adding 5 to both sides, we find x = 90. Therefore, Michael initially had 90 coins.", "answer": "90", "score": 5.725008999511268}
{"question": "Mark was collecting bottles for recycling. On Monday he had 5 bags of bottles. He found 7 bags of bottles on the next day and 3 bags of bottles the day after that. How many bags did he find after Monday?", "cot": "On Monday, Mark had 5 bags of bottles. On Tuesday, he found 7 more bags. On Wednesday, he found an additional 3 bags. To find the total number of bags he found after Monday, we only consider Tuesday and Wednesday's findings. Therefore, we need to add the bags found on Tuesday (7) and the bags found on Wednesday (3). So, 7 + 3 = 10 bags found after Monday.", "answer": "10", "score": 5.2189001381512945}
{"question": "Liam was collecting bottles for recycling. On Saturday he had 14 bins of bottles. He found 1 bin of bottles on the next day and 7 bins of bottles the day after that. How many bins did he have in total?", "cot": "Liam originally had 14 bins of bottles on Saturday. The next day, he found 1 more bin, bringing the total to 14 + 1 = 15 bins. Then, on the day after that, he found 7 more bins, which increases the total to 15 + 7 = 22 bins. Therefore, after collecting all the bins, Liam has a total of 22 bins.", "answer": "22", "score": 5.155651552252569}
{"question": "Kevin received a batch of toy cars for his birthday. By the end of the summer, he had either lost or given away 60 cars and was left with just 24. How many toy cars did he start with?", "cot": "Let x represent the number of toy cars Kevin started with. According to the problem, he lost or gave away 60 cars, which means he has 24 cars left after that. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 60 = 24. To find x, we can add 60 to both sides of the equation: x = 24 + 60. Simplifying that gives us x = 84. Therefore, Kevin started with 84 toy cars.", "answer": "Therefore, the answer is (84).", "score": 5.5686883571048575}
{"question": "Jack got a collection of stickers for his birthday. During the playtime, he gave away 40 stickers to his classmates while he lost 150 stickers. If he only had 10 stickers left, how many stickers had been lost or given away?", "cot": "Let x be the number of stickers Jack initially had. He gave away 40 stickers and lost 150 stickers, resulting in a total of 40 + 150 = 190 stickers given away or lost. After these losses, Jack has 10 stickers left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 190 = 10. Solving for x gives us x = 10 + 190 = 200. This means Jack initially had 200 stickers, and the total number of stickers he lost or gave away is 190.", "answer": "190", "score": 5.549705708361934}
{"question": "Daniel is organizing a game night and needs to buy drink bottles. He bought 9 bottles, with each bottle containing the same volume of juice. How much juice is in each bottle?", "cot": "Daniel has purchased 9 bottles of juice. The problem states that all bottles contain the same volume of juice, but it does not provide specific information about the total volume of juice or the volume of each bottle. Hence, we cannot determine the amount of juice in each bottle without additional information about the total volume of liquid purchased. Therefore, we cannot provide a numerical answer based on the given information.", "answer": "Therefore, the answer is (undefined).", "score": 5.346654865861669}
