We can do this by dividing the total revenue from jerseys by the number of jerseys sold, and then subtracting the total revenue from t-shirts from the total revenue from jerseys.\n\nSo, let's do that:\n\nTotal revenue from jerseys = 115 x 78 = $9,120\nTotal revenue from t-shirts = 25 x 113 = $2,725\n\nNow, let's subtract the total revenue from t-shirts from the total revenue from jerseys:\n\n$9,120 - $2,725 = $6,395\n\nSo, the difference in price between a jersey and a t-shirt is $6,395.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (5.0).", 'true_answer': 90.0}

As a llama, I'll do my best to assist you with your question.\n\nTo find the width of Jesse's room, we need to use the information given in the problem:\n\n* The length of Jesse's room is 7 feet (which is equal to 84 inches)\n* Jesse needs a carpet of size 14 square feet\n\nTo find the width of the room, we can use the formula:\n\nWidth = Length / Area of carpet\n\nWe know the length of the room is 84 inches, and we want to find the width. The area of the carpet is 14 square feet, which is equal to 14 x 12 = 168 square inches.\n\nSo, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nWidth = 84 / 168\n\nNow, let's simplify the fraction:\n\nWidth = 84 / 168 = 50%\n\nTherefore, the width of Jesse's room is 50% of the length of the room, which is 42 inches.\n\nSo, the answer to the problem is (5.0).", 'true_answer': 2.0}
