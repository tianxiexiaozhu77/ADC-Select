So, the total number of students who suggested adding a vegetable (tomatoes or potatoes) is 79.\n\nNow, we want to find out how many more students suggested mashed potatoes than suggested tomatoes. To do this, we can subtract the number of students who suggested tomatoes from the number of students who suggested potatoes:\n\n611 - 79 = 532\n\nTherefore, there are 532 more students who suggested mashed potatoes than suggested tomatoes.

First, we need to find out how much Olivia spent at the supermarket. We know that there were 26 dollars left in her wallet after she visited the supermarket, so the amount she spent at the supermarket must be equal to the difference between the initial amount in her wallet and the amount left after the visit.\n\nSo, the amount Olivia spent at the supermarket is:\n\n26 dollars - 106 dollars = -79 dollars\n\nYes, you read that correctly! Olivia spent -79 dollars at the supermarket.\n\n2. Now, we need to find out how much she spent at the showroom. We know that she spent 49 dollars at the showroom, so the amount she spent at the showroom is:\n\n49 dollars\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(5.0)\n\nI hope that helps!
