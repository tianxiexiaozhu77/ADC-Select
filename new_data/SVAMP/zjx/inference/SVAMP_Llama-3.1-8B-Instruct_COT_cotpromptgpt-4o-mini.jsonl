Since we don't know the exact number of emails he received in the evening, let's call it x. \nSo, the total number of emails he received in the morning and the evening is 6 + x.\n\nWe know that Jack received a total of 10 emails in the day.

Matthew had 24 crackers initially.\n2. He gave an equal number of crackers to his 3 friends.\n3. Let's assume the number of crackers he gave to each friend is 'x'.\n4. Since he gave 'x' crackers to 3 friends, the total number of crackers he gave away is 3x.\n5. After giving away the crackers, he had 17 crackers left.\n6. So, the total number of crackers he had initially (24) minus the number of crackers he gave away (3x) is equal to the number of crackers he had left (17).\n7. We can write this as an equation: 24 - 3x = 17\n8. To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation: -3x = 17 - 24\n9. Simplifying the right side of the equation: -3x = -7\n10. To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -3: x = -7 / -3\n11. Simplifying the right side of the equation: x = 7/3\n12. Since x represents the number of crackers Matthew gave to each friend, and we want the answer in whole numbers, we can multiply x by 3 to get the total number of crackers he gave to his friends: 3 * (7/3) = 7\n\nTherefore, the answer is 7.", 'true_answer': 7.0}

However, this is incorrect because you can't have a negative number of customers. This means that the waiter must have had more customers after some left. \n\nLet's recalculate: \n\nThe waiter had 14 customers after some left, so the number of customers increased. To find out how many customers left, we subtract the initial number of customers (12) from the number of customers he had after some left (14).\n\n14 - 12 = 2. This means that 2 customers left.\n\nNow, the waiter had 12 - 2 = 10 customers.\n\nThen, he got 10 new customers.

Mary needs 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar in total.\n2. She still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar, which means the amount of flour she has left to add is 2 cups more than the amount of sugar she has left to add.\n3. Let's represent the amount of sugar she has left to add as 'x'. Then, the amount of flour she has left to add is 'x + 2'.\n4. Since she needs 7 cups of sugar in total, the amount of sugar she has already added is 7 - x.\n5. Similarly, since she needs 11 cups of flour in total, the amount of flour she has already added is 11 - (x + 2) = 11 - x - 2 = 9 - x.\n6. We know that the amount of flour she has already added is the difference between the total amount of flour and the amount of flour she has left to add, which is 9 - x.\n7. So, we can set up the equation: 9 - x = 7 - x + 2.\n8. Simplifying the equation, we get: 9 - x = 9 - x + 2.\n9. However, this equation is not correct because it doesn't make sense. Let's re-evaluate the problem.\n10. Let's represent the amount of sugar she has already added as 'y'. Then, the amount of flour she has already added is 'y + 2'.\n11.

We know that 246 visitors came on the day Rachel visited, and 703 visitors came the day before. To find the average number of visitors per day, we can add these two numbers and divide by 2.\n\n(246 + 703) / 2 = 949 / 2 = 474.5\n\nNow, we multiply this average by 23 to find the total number of visitors for the remaining 23 days.\n\n474.5 * 23 = 10,897.5\n\nNow, we add the visitors from the previous day (703) and the day Rachel visited (246) to the total number of visitors for the remaining 23 days.\n\n10,897.5 + 703 + 246 = 11,846.5\n\nTherefore, the answer is 11,846.5.", 'true_answer': 949.0}

Let's say the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is x.\n2.

We know that the total number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes and bacon is 182 + (x + 166).\n4. However, we are given that 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes, so the total number of students who suggested adding bacon is actually 182 + (x + 166).\n5.

After finding more, he now has 65 wrappers and 31 + 5 = 36 bottle caps.\n\nSo, the number of wrappers he found at the park is 65 - 9 = 56.\nThe number of bottle caps he found at the park is 36 - 5 = 31.\n\nNow, we can find the difference between the number of wrappers and bottle caps he found at the park: 56 - 31 = 25.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 25.', 'true_answer': 60.0}
{'question': 'Faye was placing her pencils into rows with 22 pencils in each row. She had 6 packs of pencils each one having 14 pencils.

How many pencils does she have?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n\nPlease give the final answer in arabic numerals, as 'Therefore, the answer is (5.0).'", 'pred_answer': "To find the total number of pencils Faye has, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. First, we need to find out how many pencils are in all the packs. Since Faye has 6 packs of pencils, each with 14 pencils, we multiply the number of packs by the number of pencils in each pack.\n\n   Number of packs: 6\n   Pencils in each pack: 14\n   Total pencils in packs = Number of packs * Pencils in each pack\n   Total pencils in packs = 6 * 14\n   Total pencils in packs = 84\n\n2. Now, we know that Faye is placing the pencils into rows with 22 pencils in each row. To find out how many rows she can make, we need to divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each row.\n\n   Total pencils in packs: 84\n   Pencils in each row: 22\n   Number of rows = Total pencils in packs / Pencils in each row\n   Number of rows = 84 / 22\n   Number of rows = 3.8181 (approximately)\n\n   Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we can say that Faye can make 3 full rows with 22 pencils in each row. However, this doesn't tell us the total number of pencils she has. To find that, we need to multiply the number of full rows by the number of pencils in each row and then add the remaining pencils.\n\n   Pencils in 3 full rows = Number of rows * Pencils in each row\n   Pencils in 3 full rows = 3 * 22\n   Pencils in 3 full rows = 66\n\n   Now, we need to find the remaining pencils. To do this, we subtract the number of pencils in 3 full rows from the total number of pencils in packs.\n\n   Remaining pencils = Total pencils in packs - Pencils in 3 full rows\n   Remaining pencils = 84 - 66\n   Remaining pencils = 18\n\n   Now, we add the pencils in 3 full rows and the remaining pencils to find the total number of pencils Faye has.\n\n   Total pencils = Pencils in 3 full rows + Remaining pencils\n   Total pencils = 66 + 18\n   Total pencils = 84\n\nTherefore, the answer is 84.", 'true_answer': 84.0}
