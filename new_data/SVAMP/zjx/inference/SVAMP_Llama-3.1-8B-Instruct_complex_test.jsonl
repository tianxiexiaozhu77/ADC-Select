{'question': "There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 2 groups and oranges are organized into 93 groups. How big is each group of bananas?", 'idx': 0, 'prompt': "Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There were 39 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 661 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 600 visitors the previous day. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the current day compared to the previous day, we start by noting the number of visitors for each day. The current day had 661 visitors, and the previous day had 600 visitors. We need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number on the current day: 661 - 600 = 61. Thus, there were 61 more visitors on that day than on the previous day.\nTherefore, the answer is (61.0)\n\nQ: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the day in question compared to the previous 245 days, we first need to calculate the total number of visitors over those days. This can be achieved by averaging the known visitors over the previous three days, assuming that they represent a reasonable estimate of visitor numbers for the 245 days prior.\n\n1. Visitors on Day X (the day in question) = 705\n2. Visitors the previous day (Day X-1) = 191\n3. Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. Now we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today from those baked yesterday to find out how many more she baked yesterday compared to today. Therefore, we calculate 197 - 66, which equals 131 cookies.\nTherefore, the answer is (131.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more raisin cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 300 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 280 raisin cookies. Now, we will subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday: 300 - 280 = 20. This tells us that Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested bacon be denoted as x. According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 2 groups and oranges are organized into 93 groups. How big is each group of bananas?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", 'pred_answer': 'To find the size of each group of bananas, we need to divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups. \n\nThere are 290 bananas in total and they are organized into 2 groups. \n\nSo, the size of each group of bananas is 290 / 2 = 145.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (145.0)', 'true_answer': 145.0}
