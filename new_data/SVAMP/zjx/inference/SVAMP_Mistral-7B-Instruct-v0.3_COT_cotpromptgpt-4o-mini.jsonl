We know that she had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards initially. After giving some cards to Jeff, she has 415 cards left in total (both baseball and Ace cards).\n\nLet x be the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff.

The machine made 8 shirts today.\n2. Since it makes 2 shirts a minute, we can find out how many minutes it took to make 8 shirts by dividing the number of shirts by the number of shirts made per minute: 8 shirts / 2 shirts per minute = 4 minutes.\n3. However, we need to account for the time it worked yesterday as well. Since it made 9 shirts yesterday, and it makes 2 shirts a minute, it took 9 shirts / 2 shirts per minute = 4.5 minutes to make all the shirts yesterday.\n4. To find out how many minutes it worked today, we subtract the time it worked yesterday from the total time it worked today and yesterday: 4 minutes (today) + 4.5 minutes (yesterday) = 8.5 minutes.\n5. Since we are looking for the answer in whole minutes, we round up to the nearest whole number: 8.5 minutes ≈ 9 minutes.

Subtracting the remaining 68 books from the initial amount gives us the number of books he sold, which is 95 - 68 = 27. However, since we are asked to find the number of books he sold in the garage sale, we should consider the books he gave to his friend as well.

They harvest 76 sacks per day.\n2. Each sack contains 50 oranges.\n3. However, they discard 64 sacks, which means they keep 12 sacks (76 - 64).\n4. Since they keep 12 sacks and each sack contains 50 oranges, the total number of oranges they keep is 12 * 50 = 600 oranges.\n5. Since they discard 64 sacks, the total number of oranges they discard is 64 * 50 = 3200 oranges.\n6. To find the total number of oranges they harvest, we subtract the discarded oranges from the kept oranges: 600 - 3200 = -2600.\n7. Since the number of oranges harvested cannot be negative, we need to consider the absolute value of the difference, which is 2600.\n8. However, since they discard 64 sacks, we need to subtract the number of oranges in those 64 sacks from the total harvested oranges to account for the ones that were discarded but should have been kept: 2600 - 64 * 50 = 2600 - 3200 = -600.\n9. Again, since the number of oranges harvested cannot be negative, we need to consider the absolute value of the difference, which is the correct number of oranges harvested: 600.\n10. However, since we made an error in our initial calculation, we need to subtract the number of oranges we initially counted as harvested (600) from the total number of oranges we should have kept (600): 600 - 600 = 0.\n11. This means that our initial calculation was incorrect, and we need to consider the number of oranges in the 12 sacks we kept: 12 * 50 = 600.\n12. Since we discarded 64 sacks, we need to add the number of oranges in those 64 sacks to the total number of oranges we should have kept: 600 + 64 * 50 = 600 + 3200 = 3800.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (3800).", 'true_answer': 600.0}

How many more push-ups than crunches did Zachary do?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n\nPlease give the final answer in arabic numerals, as 'Therefore, the answer is (5.0).'", 'pred_answer': "Let's denote the number of push-ups Zachary did as P and the number of crunches as C.\n\nWe know that P = 35 and C = 3.\n\nDavid did 58 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can write the number of push-ups David did as D = P + 58 = 35 + 58 = 93.\n\nWe also know that David did 87 less crunches than Zachary. So, the number of crunches David did is C_d = C - 87.\n\nSince the number of push-ups David did is greater than the number of crunches he did, we can say that the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches David did is positive.\n\nLet's find this difference: D - C_d = 93 - (C - 87) = 93 - C + 87 = 180 - C.\n\nSince we know that Zachary did P push-ups and C crunches, and the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches he did is positive, we can say that the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches Zachary did is also positive.\n\nLet's find this difference: P - C = 35 - 3 = 32.\n\nSince the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches David did is greater than the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches Zachary did, we can say that the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches David did is greater than or equal to the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches Zachary did.\n\nIn other words, 180 - C >= 32.\n\nSolving this inequality for C, we get C <= 148.\n\nSince C is an integer and we know that C = 3, the only possible value for C that satisfies the inequality is C = 3.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches Zachary did is P - C = 35 - 3 = 32.\n\nIn arabic numerals, the answer is (32).", 'true_answer': 32.0}

However, since we are dealing with school buses, it's more likely that each bus has a standard number of seats, such as 50 or 60.\n\nIf we assume each bus has 60 seats, then the answer would be 26.366666666666668 * 60 ≈ 1579.9999999999998 ≈ 1580 seats per bus (rounded down).\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 1580 seats in each bus.", 'true_answer': 2.0}

Since A < J, the maximum value for A is 1 (otherwise, A would be greater than J, which violates the inequality). So, let's try J = 2.\n\nIf J = 2, then A + J + 4 = 6, which gives A = -2.

How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n\nPlease give the final answer in arabic numerals, as 'Therefore, the answer is (5.0).'", 'pred_answer': "Therefore, the answer is (18). Initially, Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had 24 + Doug's marbles. Doug lost 27 marbles, leaving him with Doug's marbles - 27. Ed found 9 more marbles, so now he has Ed's marbles + 9. The difference between the number of marbles Ed and Doug have is (Ed's marbles + 9) - (Doug's marbles - 27). Simplifying this expression gives us (24 + Doug's marbles + 9) - (Doug's marbles - 27) = 24 + 9 + 27 - Doug's marbles = 18 + Doug's marbles. Since we know that Ed initially had 24 more marbles than Doug, we can say that Doug's marbles is 24 - 18 = 6. Substituting this value back into the equation gives us 18 + 6 = 24, which is the initial difference between the number of marbles Ed and Doug had. However, since we are asked to find the difference after the events at the playground, we should use the final number of marbles Doug has, which is Doug's marbles - 27. So, the final difference is 24 + 9 - (Doug's marbles - 27) = 33 - Doug's marbles. Since we know that Doug's marbles is 6, the final difference is 33 - 6 = 27. However, this answer is incorrect because it represents the difference after the events at the playground, but the question asks for the difference before the events at the playground. To find the difference before the events at the playground, we should use the initial number of marbles Doug had, which is 6. So, the final answer is 24 - 6 = 18.", 'true_answer': 60.0}

How many peaches does Jake have?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n\nPlease give the final answer in arabic numerals, as 'Therefore, the answer is (5.0).'", 'pred_answer': "Therefore, the answer is (17.0).\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Let's denote the number of peaches Jake has as P and the number of apples he has as A.\n2. We know that Steven has 19 peaches and 14 apples, and he has 12 fewer peaches and 79 more apples than Jake. So, we can write the following equations:\n   - P - 19 = Jake's peaches\n   - 14 + 79 = Steven's apples - Jake's apples\n3. Now, let's solve for Jake's peaches:\n   - Jake's peaches = P = 19 + P (from the first equation)\n4. To find the value of P, we can use the second equation to find the difference in the number of apples:\n   - 93 = Steven's apples - Jake's apples\n5. Since we know the number of apples for both Jake and Steven, we can now find the number of apples Jake has:\n   - Jake's apples = 14 - 93 = -89 (However, since the number of apples cannot be negative, we need to find the absolute value of -89, which is 89.)\n6. Now, we can find the number of peaches Jake has using the first equation:\n   - P = 19 + P\n   - P - P + 19 = 19 (since P = Jake's peaches)\n   - 2 * P = 38\n   - P = 38 / 2 = 19 / 1 (since P is the number of peaches Jake has)\n7. However, we made an error in step 5, where we should have subtracted the number of apples Jake has from the number of apples Steven has, not the other way around. So, the correct number of apples Jake has is:\n   - Jake's apples = 14 + 89 = 103\n8. Now, we can find the number of peaches Jake has using the first equation:\n   - P = 19 + P\n   - P - P + 19 = 19 (since P = Jake's peaches)\n   - 2 * P = 38\n   - P = 38 / 2 = 19 / 1 (since P is the number of peaches Jake has)\n9. But we already found the value of P in step 6, and it was 19. Since we made an error in step 5, we need to subtract the number of apples Jake has from the number of apples Steven has:\n   - Jake's apples = Steven's apples - 103\n10. Now, we can find the number of peaches Jake has using the first equation:\n   - P = 19 + P\n   - P - P + 19 = 19 (since P = Jake's peaches)\n   - 2 * P = 38\n   - P = 38 / 2 = 19 / 1 (since P is the number of peaches Jake has)\n11. However, we already found the value of P in step 6, and it was 19. Since we made an error in step 5, we need to subtract the number of apples Jake has from the number of apples Steven has:\n   - Jake's apples = Steven's apples - 103\n   - Jake's apples = 14 - 103 = -89 (However, since the number of apples cannot be negative, we need to find the absolute value of -89, which is 89.)\n12.

We made the same error twice, so we need to subtract the number of apples Jake has from the number of apples Steven has:\n   - Jake's apples = Steven's apples - 103\n14.

Since the number of orchids increased from 20 to 21, the difference in the number of orchids is 21 - 20 = 1.\n\nHowever, since Jessica cut more flowers, the difference in the number of roses should be greater than the difference in the number of orchids.

Each classroom has the same number of students, and there are 87 classrooms. So, the total number of students is 87 * number_of_students_per_classroom.\n\n2. We know that there are 58 students in the school, so number_of_students_per_classroom = 58 / 87 ≈ 0.667. Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 1 student per classroom.\n\n3. Now, we know that there are 87 classrooms with 1 student each, so there are 87 students in total.\n\n4. Each school bus can accommodate 2 seats, and we need to seat all 87 students. So, the number of buses needed is 87 / 2 = 43.5.\n\n5. Since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 44 buses. However, since the question asks for the number of buses needed to take the trip, we should consider that some students might be able to share a seat, reducing the number of buses needed. In this case, if every other student shares a seat, we can accommodate 94 students with 44 seats (44 buses * 2 seats). This leaves 11 students unaccounted for. If we assume that these 11 students share a seat with another student, we can accommodate all students with 43 buses.\n\n6. Therefore, the answer is (43.5).", 'true_answer': 29.0}

How many crackers and cakes did each person eat?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n\nPlease give the final answer in arabic numerals, as 'Therefore, the answer is (5.0).'", 'pred_answer': "First, let's find out how many crackers and cakes Matthew gave to each friend. Since he had 28 friends in total, and he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes, we can find the number of crackers and cakes per friend by dividing the initial amount of each by the number of friends.\n\nFor crackers:\nCrackers per friend = Total crackers / Number of friends\n= 13 / 28\n\nSince the number of crackers per friend is a fraction, we can't directly say how many crackers each friend ate. However, if we multiply this fraction by the total number of friends, we will get the total number of crackers given to all friends, which should be the same as the initial amount of crackers minus the remaining crackers.\n\nTotal crackers given = Initial crackers * Crackers per friend * Number of friends\n= 13 * (13/28) * 28\n= 13 * 13\n= 169\n\nSince there were initially 13 crackers and 169 were given away, the remaining crackers are:\n\nRemaining crackers = Initial crackers - Total crackers given\n= 13 - 169\n= -156\n\nSince the number of crackers should be positive, this means there was a mistake in the question, as it's not possible to give away more crackers than there are initially.\n\nFor cakes, the calculation would be similar:\n\nCakes per friend = Total cakes / Number of friends\n= 15 / 28\n\nTotal cakes given = Initial cakes * Cakes per friend * Number of friends\n= 15 * (15/28) * 28\n= 15 * 15\n= 225\n\nSince there were initially 15 cakes and 225 were given away, the remaining cakes are:\n\nRemaining cakes = Initial cakes - Total cakes given\n= 15 - 225\n= -210\n\nAgain, since the number of cakes should be positive, there was a mistake in the question.\n\nIn summary, there was a mistake in the question, and it's not possible to determine how many crackers and cakes each friend ate based on the given information.", 'true_answer': 1.0}
