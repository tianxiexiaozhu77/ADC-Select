If we let x represent the number of pages in each chapter, then we can set up the equation:\n\n41x = 450\n\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 41:\n\nx = 450 / 41 = 11.02439024390244\n\nHowever, we know that the number of pages in a chapter cannot be a fraction. This means that we must have made a mistake in our calculation. Let's retrace our steps and try again.\n\nWe know that the book has 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages, and the total number of pages is 450.

We know that it took him 30 days to finish the book. To find out how many pages he read per day, we divide the total number of pages by the number of days:\n\n450 / 30 = 15\n\nTherefore, Frank read 15 pages per day.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{15}$.", 'true_answer': 15.0}

According to the problem, the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, so we can write the equation: G = F + 4, where G is the distance the grasshopper jumped (19 inches). We know that G = 19, so we can substitute it into the equation: 19 = F + 4.\n\nTo find the distance the frog jumped, we need to solve for F. We can do this by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation: 19 - 4 = F, so F = 15. This means the frog jumped 15 inches.\n\nNow, we know that the mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog. So, the distance the mouse jumped, M, can be found by the equation: M = F - 44. Substituting the value of F = 15 into the equation gives: M = 15 - 44 = -29.

We know that 13 boys love to play marbles and 50 boys love to play cards. So, the total number of boys is 13 + 50 = 63 boys.\n\nHaley has 26 marbles to distribute among these boys. To find out how many marbles each boy will receive, we divide the total number of marbles by the total number of boys. So, 26 marbles / 63 boys = 0.4126984126984127 marbles per boy.\n\nHowever, it doesn't make sense to give each boy a fraction of a marble. So, we need to round this number to the nearest whole number.

If we give each boy 1 marble, we will have some marbles left over.\n\nTo decide how many marbles to give each boy, we need to see how many marbles we can give out without running out. If we give each boy 1 marble, we will distribute 63 marbles, which is more than the 26 marbles we have.
