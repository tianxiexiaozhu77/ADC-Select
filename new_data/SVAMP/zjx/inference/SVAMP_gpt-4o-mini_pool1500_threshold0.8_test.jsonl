{'question': "There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 2 groups and oranges are organized into 93 groups. How big is each group of bananas?", 'idx': 0, 'prompt': "Q: There are 160 coconuts and 320 grapes in Ava's collection. If the grapes are organized into 8 groups and coconuts are organized into 40 groups. How big is each group of grapes?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the size of each group of grapes, we need to divide the total number of grapes by the number of groups. We know there are 320 grapes and they are divided into 8 groups. The calculation is as follows: Total grapes = 320, Number of groups = 8. Therefore, size of each group of grapes = Total grapes / Number of groups = 320 / 8 = 40. Thus, each group of grapes contains 40 grapes.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: There are 150 apples and 300 grapes in Sarah's collection. If the grapes are organized into 3 groups and apples are organized into 75 groups. How big is each group of grapes?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the size of each group of grapes, we need to divide the total number of grapes by the number of groups. There are 300 grapes and they are organized into 3 groups. So, the calculation is: 300 grapes / 3 groups = 100 grapes per group.\nTherefore, the answer is (100)\n\nQ: There are 130 peaches and 370 passion fruits in Olivia's collection. If the passion fruits are organized into 1 group and peaches are organized into 65 groups. How big is each group of passion fruits?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the size of each group of passion fruits, we start with the total number of passion fruits, which is 370. Since the passion fruits are organized into 1 group, we simply need to find the size of that single group. The size of the group is equal to the total number of passion fruits because there's only one group. Therefore, the size of the group is 370.\nTherefore, the answer is (370)\n\nQ: There are 200 strawberries and 500 blueberries in Emma's collection. If the blueberries are organized into 5 groups and strawberries are organized into 100 groups. How big is each group of blueberries?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the size of each group of blueberries, we need to divide the total number of blueberries by the number of groups. We have 500 blueberries and they are organized into 5 groups. Thus, we calculate the size of each group by performing the division: 500 blueberries รท 5 groups = 100 blueberries per group.\nTherefore, the answer is (100)\n\nQ: There are 120 pears and 240 cherries in John's collection. If the cherries are organized into 4 groups and pears are organized into 60 groups. How big is each group of cherries?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how big each group of cherries is, we need to divide the total number of cherries by the number of groups. We start with the total number of cherries, which is 240, and divide it by the number of groups, which is 4. This calculation looks like: 240 cherries รท 4 groups = 60 cherries per group. Therefore, each group of cherries contains 60 cherries.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQ: There are 90 pomegranates and 400 blackberries in Noah's collection. If the blackberries are organized into 10 groups and pomegranates are organized into 45 groups. How big is each group of blackberries?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the size of each group of blackberries, we need to divide the total number of blackberries by the number of groups they are organized into. Noah has 400 blackberries and they are organized into 10 groups. Therefore, we perform the division: 400 blackberries / 10 groups = 40 blackberries per group. Thus, each group of blackberries contains 40 blackberries.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: There are 75 kiwis and 210 limes in Mia's collection. If the limes are organized into 7 groups and kiwis are organized into 25 groups. How big is each group of limes?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the size of each group of limes, we need to divide the total number of limes by the number of groups they are organized into. The problem states that there are 210 limes in total and that they are organized into 7 groups. Thus, we perform the calculation: 210 limes รท 7 groups = 30 limes per group. Therefore, each group of limes contains 30 limes.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\nQ: There are 60 pineapple and 180 mangoes in Liam's collection. If the mangoes are organized into 6 groups and pineapples are organized into 30 groups. How big is each group of mangoes?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how big each group of mangoes is, we need to divide the total number of mangoes by the number of groups. We have 180 mangoes organized into 6 groups. Therefore, we calculate the size of each group by dividing 180 by 6.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\nQuestion: There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection.
