Each week has seven days, so there are 364 days in the year (52*7 - 1, because a year doesn't have a full 365 days).\n\nFridays occur every 7 days, so in a year with 364 days, there will be 52 Fridays (364/7).\n\nHowever, a year with 364 days has an extra day compared to a year with 365 days, and this extra day is not a Friday. Therefore, the number of Fridays in a year with 364 days is not more than the number of Fridays in a year with 365 days.\n\nSince the number of Fridays in a year with 365 days is not more than the number of Fridays in a typical year (which has 366 days in a leap year), it follows that the number of Fridays in 2015, which is a year with 364 days, is not more than the number of Fridays in a typical year.\n\nTherefore, 2015 does not have more unlucky Fridays than usual.", 'true_answer': 'Yes'}
