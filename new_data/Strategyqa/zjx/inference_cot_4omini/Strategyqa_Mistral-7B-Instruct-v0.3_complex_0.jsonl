Let's assume an average Bible has 1000 pages, and a person can read 200 pages per hour.\n\nNext, we need to know the number of Wednesdays in a year. A non-leap year has 52 weeks, and since there are seven days in a week, there are 52 * 7 = 364 days in a year. A leap year has 366 days.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of Wednesdays in a year:\n- In a non-leap year, there are 364 days, and Wednesdays occur every 7 days, so there are 364 / 7 = 52 Wednesdays.\n- In a leap year, there are 366 days, and Wednesdays occur every 7 days, so there are 366 / 7 = 52 Wednesdays + 1 extra day, which is not a Wednesday.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the number of hours needed to read the Bible 15 times on Wednesdays:\n- In a non-leap year, there are 52 Wednesdays, and if a person can read 200 pages per hour, they can read 52 * 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day) * 200 = 2,448,000 pages in a year. Since there are 1000 pages in a Bible, a person can read 2,448 Bibles in a year. Reading 15 Bibles would take 2,448 / 15 = 163.2 hours, which is not possible since there are only 8760 hours in a year.\n- In a leap year, the calculation is the same, and it's also not possible to read 15 Bibles in a year.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (No), it is not possible to read the Bible 15 times on Wednesdays in a year.", 'true_answer': 'Yes'}

To find out if March begins on the same day of the week as February in a leap year, we need to compare the day of the week for the 29th of February and the 1st of March.\n\nTo do this, we can use the formula for finding the day of the week (modulo 7) for a given date:\n\nDay of the week = (day number + floor((month number + floor(year/100) + 1) / 12) * 5 + year % 100 + floor(year/400)) % 7\n\nLet's calculate the day of the week for February 29th and March 1st in a leap year:\n\nFebruary 29th (leap year):\nday number = 29\nmonth number = 2\nyear = the given year (leap year)\n\nday of the week (February 29th) = (29 + floor((2 + floor(year/100) + 1) / 12) * 5 + year % 100 + floor(year/400)) % 7\n\nMarch 1st (leap year):\nday number = 1\nmonth number = 3\nyear = the given year (leap year)\n\nday of the week (March 1st) = (1 + floor((3 + floor(year/100) + 1) / 12) * 5 + year % 100 + floor(year/400)) % 7\n\nSince both February 29th and March 1st are in the same year, the only difference in the formula is the month number (2 vs. 3). However, the term floor((month number + floor(year/100) + 1) / 12) * 5 is always an integer, so it doesn't affect the remainder when we take the result modulo 7. Therefore, the day of the week for February 29th and March 1st will be the same in a leap year.\n\nSo, the answer is (Yes) March begins on the same day of the week as February during leap years.", 'true_answer': 'No'}

Therefore, it's impossible to definitively say whether the Tiny House ceiling was out of Osama bin Laden's reach or not.\n\nHowever, if we're interpreting the question in a more metaphorical sense, one could argue that the Tiny House (symbolizing a simple life) was out of reach for someone like Osama bin Laden, who was associated with extremism and violence. But this interpretation is speculative and not based on factual evidence.", 'true_answer': 'No'}

First, let\'s find out the average sales of an AC/DC album and Lil Wayne\'s album.\n   - AC/DC\'s "Back in Black" is one of the best-selling albums of all time, with over 50 million copies sold. However, not all of their albums have sold this much. Let\'s assume an average of 10 million copies sold per album.\n   - Lil Wayne\'s "Tha Carter III" is one of his best-selling albums, with over 3.5 million copies sold in its first week. Let\'s assume an average of 1 million copies sold per album.\n\n2. Next, let\'s find out the cost of a B-52 bomber. A B-52H Stratofortress costs around $150 million.\n\n3. Now, let\'s compare the sales of AC/DC and Lil Wayne\'s albums with the cost of a B-52 bomber.\n   - AC/DC albums: 10 million copies * (average album price, let\'s say $10) = $100 million\n   - Lil Wayne\'s albums: 1 million copies * ($10) = $10 million\n\n4.

To find out if 2015 had more unlucky Fridays than usual, we need to count the number of Fridays that fall on the 13th of a month in that year.\n\nTo do this, we can create a table with the days of the week repeating every seven days, and mark the 13th of each month:\n\n```\nJan  Fri 13 (unlucky)\nFeb  Sat\nMar  Sun\nApr  Mon\nMay  Tue\nJun  Wed\nJul  Thu\nAug  Fri 13 (unlucky)\nSep  Sat\nOct  Sun\nNov  Mon\nDec  Tue\n```\n\nAs you can see, there are two unlucky Fridays in 2015. To determine if this is more than usual, we can compare it to the number of unlucky Fridays in a typical year.\n\nIn a non-leap year, there are 52 weeks, and each week has seven days. So there are 52 * 7 = 364 days in a non-leap year. Since there are 12 months, each month has 30.42 days on average (364 / 12).\n\nThe 13th of the month occurs approximately every 28.2 days (1 month / 12 * 28.2 = 28.2). To find out how many unlucky Fridays occur in a typical year, we can divide the number of days in a year by the number of days between the 13th of a month and the next 13th:\n\n```\nUnlucky Fridays per year = (364 days) / (28.2 days) ≈ 12.9\n```\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a Friday, we round this number down to 12. This means that in a typical year, we would expect to have 12 unlucky Fridays.\n\nTherefore, 2015 had more unlucky Fridays than usual.", 'true_answer': 'Yes'}

They were created by crossing the two species in Brazil in the 1950s. Africanized bees have spread throughout South and North America, replacing European honey bees in many areas.\n\nThe term "multicultural" is often used to describe a community or group that includes people of different ethnic, racial, or cultural backgrounds. Africanized bees are not a group of people, but rather a specific type of animal. However, they are a hybrid of two different species of bees, one from Europe and one from Africa, so in a metaphorical sense, they could be considered "multicultural."\n\nHowever, it\'s important to note that using the term "multicultural" to describe a non-human species may not be accurate or appropriate in all contexts. In this case, it\'s more accurate to say that Africanized bees are a hybrid of two different species of bees, one from Europe and one from Africa.', 'true_answer': 'Yes'}

Closing stomata reduces water loss, which is beneficial in arid environments. However, closing stomata too much can also limit the intake of carbon dioxide, which is necessary for photosynthesis.\n\nIn the context of aerodynamics, a cactus's shape can help it reduce air resistance, allowing it to withstand strong winds. However, the question doesn't directly relate to aerodynamics.\n\nTo answer the question more specifically, if we consider the impact of stomata closure on water conservation, then yes, more frequently closed stomata would benefit the cactus by reducing water loss.

Alcatraz Island, located in San Francisco Bay, has an area of about 22 acres (8.9 hectares).\n\nTo fit a football field on Alcatraz Island, we would first need to find out the total area of the football field. The area of a rectangle is length times width, so the area of a football field is 100 yards * 53.3 yards = 5,330 square yards.\n\nNext, we'll convert the area of Alcatraz Island from acres to square yards. There are 43,560 square feet in an acre, and there are 9 square feet in a square yard, so there are 43,560 * 9 = 388,040 square yards in an acre. Since Alcatraz Island has an area of 22 acres, the total area of the island is 22 * 388,040 = 8,576,880 square yards.\n\nFinally, we'll compare the area of the football field to the area of Alcatraz Island. If the area of the football field is less than or equal to the area of Alcatraz Island, then it would be possible to fit the football field on the island. In this case, 5,330 square yards is less than 8,576,880 square yards, so it would be possible to fit a football field on Alcatraz Island.\n\nTherefore, the answer (Yes or No) is (Yes).", 'true_answer': 'Yes'}

The average yearly precipitation on Snowdon is about 2,500 millimeters (98 inches).\n\nTo find out if this amount of precipitation could submerge an upright bowling pin, we need to know the dimensions of the bowling pin. A standard bowling pin has a height of about 15.75 inches (40 cm), a diameter of about 6.75 inches (17 cm), and a weight of about 14.3 pounds (6.5 kg).\n\nThe volume of the bowling pin can be calculated by multiplying its height, diameter, and the cross-sectional area of the base (πr², where r is the radius). The cross-sectional area of the base is (d/2)², so the volume of the bowling pin is approximately (π * (6.75/2)² * 15.75) cubic inches.\n\nNow, let's convert the yearly precipitation on Snowdon from millimeters to cubic inches. There are 25.4 millimeters in an inch, so the yearly precipitation on Snowdon is approximately (2,500 * 25.4) cubic inches.\n\nComparing the volume of the bowling pin to the yearly precipitation on Snowdon, it's clear that the precipitation would not be enough to submerge an upright bowling pin.\n\nTherefore, the answer (Yes or No) is (No).", 'true_answer': 'Yes'}

The average density of a six-year-old child is about 0.07 g/cm^3. To find out if ten gallons of seawater could crush a six-year-old, we would need to compare their volumes and densities.\n\nFirst, let's convert the child's density to a more usable unit, like pounds per cubic foot (lb/ft^3). Since 1 g/cm^3 is equal to 0.06243 lb/ft^3, the child's density is approximately 0.0044 lb/ft^3.\n\nNext, let's find the volume of the child. Since the average volume of a six-year-old child is about 1.5 cubic feet, the child's weight would be approximately 1.5 * 0.0044 = 0.066 lb.\n\nNow, let's find the weight of ten gallons of seawater. Since 1 gallon is approximately 0.1337 ft^3, ten gallons would be approximately 1.337 ft^3. The weight of this volume of seawater would be approximately 1.337 * 1.025 = 1.364 lb.\n\nSince the weight of the seawater is greater than the weight of the child, it is theoretically possible for ten gallons of seawater to crush a six-year-old child. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified calculation and real-world scenarios would involve many other factors, such as the distribution of the weight and the child's ability to move or resist the pressure.\n\nTherefore, the answer (Yes or No) is (Yes, but with many caveats and real-world factors to consider).", 'true_answer': 'Yes'}

The Porsche 992 Turbo S is a high-performance sports car with a top speed of approximately 330 km/h (205 mph). Usain Bolt, a world-class sprinter, has a top speed of about 27.8 mph (44.7 km/h) during his fastest 100-meter sprint.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that a car can maintain a constant speed, while a human cannot. A car can accelerate from 0 to 100 meters in about 2.7 seconds, while Usain Bolt's fastest 100-meter time is 9.58 seconds.\n\nSo, in a straight line, yes, a Porsche 992 Turbo S could cover a 100-meter distance faster than Usain Bolt.

He is known for his contributions to moral philosophy, particularly his theory of deontology, which emphasizes the importance of following moral rules for their own sake.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement is a social justice movement that emerged in response to the systemic racism and police violence against Black people in the United States. The movement seeks to address and dismantle the structures and systems that perpetuate racial inequality and injustice.\n\nIt is difficult to say with certainty whether Immanuel Kant would have been disgusted by the Black Lives Matter movement, as he did not have the benefit of living in the modern world and experiencing the ongoing struggles faced by Black people in the United States. However, it is worth noting that Kant's philosophy emphasizes the importance of treating all human beings as ends in themselves, rather than as means to an end. This principle could be seen as aligning with the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement, which seeks to ensure that Black lives are valued and protected.\n\nThat being said, it is also important to recognize that Kant's philosophy has been criticized for its lack of attention to issues of race and racism. For example, Kant's theory of race posits that Black people are inherently inferior to white people, and he argued that Black people are less capable of moral reasoning than white people. These views are clearly at odds with the principles of the Black Lives Matter movement, and it is likely that Kant would have had a difficult time reconciling his philosophy with the movement's goals.\n\nIn conclusion, it is difficult to say with certainty whether Immanuel Kant would have been disgusted by the Black Lives Matter movement. While his philosophy emphasizes the importance of treating all human beings as ends in themselves, his views on race and racism are problematic and at odds with the goals of the movement.", 'true_answer': 'Yes'}
