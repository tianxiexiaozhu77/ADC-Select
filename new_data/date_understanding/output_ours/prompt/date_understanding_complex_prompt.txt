Q: Jane got her job in 2016. Today is her 3-year work anniversary. She still remember that on Dec 2, her second day at work, she spilled coffee on her laptop. What is the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?
Options:  (A) 11/23/2019  (B) 06/24/2019  (C) 03/24/2019  (D) 11/24/2019  (E) 02/29/2020
A: Let's think step by step. 
To find the date one week ago from today, we need to subtract 7 days from today's date. Today is the 3-year work anniversary of Jane, which means she started her job in 2016. Since it is currently 2019, we need to consider the leap years. February 29, 2020 (option E) is not a valid date in 2019. Therefore, the correct answer is option D: 11/24/2019.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is (D)


Q: Jane got her job in 2016. Today is her 3-year work anniversary. She still remember that on Dec 2, her second day at work, she spilled coffee on her laptop. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?
Options:  (A) 11/01/2019  (B) 11/02/2019  (C) 09/06/2019  (D) 11/01/1933  (E) 11/01/2089  (F) 08/04/2019
A: Let's think step by step. 
Jane got her job in 2016, so her second day at work was on Dec 2, 2016. Today is her 3-year work anniversary, which means today's date is Dec 2, 2019. To find the date a month ago, we need to subtract one month from Dec 2, 2019. This gives us Nov 2, 2019 as the date a month ago.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is (A)

Options:  (A) 08/16/2009  (B) 02/16/2009  (C) 02/16/2004  (D) 03/13/2009  (E) 01/26/2009  (F) 02/15/2009
A: Let's think step by step. 
Jane visits the bookstore on the 16th of each month starting from October 2009. Since it is her 5th visit today, we need to go back 4 months to find the date one year ago. Counting back 4 months from the current month (October) brings us to June. Therefore, the date one year ago from today would be 06/16/2009.
Therefore, among A through F, the answer is (B)

Since February only has 28 or 29 days, the correct answer is C) 03/01/2010.
