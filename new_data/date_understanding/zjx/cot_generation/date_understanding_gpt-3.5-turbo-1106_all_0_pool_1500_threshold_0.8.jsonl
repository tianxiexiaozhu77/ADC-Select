To find the date eight months ago, we subtract eight months from January 30, 2023. Moving backwards by eight months would take us to May 30, 2022. Therefore, eight months prior to her 23rd birthday is May 30, 2022. Now, we need to check which date among the options matches with May 30, 2022, but since the options provided are all in the year 2023, we need to consider the equivalent date in 2023. Eight months prior to January 30, 2023, would be May 30, 2022. However, if we are looking for the date in 2023, we need to find the corresponding date in 2023 that is 8 months before January 30, which lands us on May 30, 2023. The closest match in the options is therefore option A, which is 05/30/2023.", "answer": "A", "score": 5.813437354483387}

Now, we need the date that corresponds to one year ago from her 18th birthday in the provided options. The relevant comparison shows that to find one year before April 15, 2023, we should reach April 15, 2022. Looking at the options, none of them directly provide April 15, 2022. However, we can deduce that since today is 2023, the only option that could logically reflect a date in 2020 as being a year ago (from 2021) is (A) which refers to 2020. So, the correct interpretation for the date a year ago is April 15, 2022, which correlates with option (D) as being the closest, but is not provided. Since no fitting date is in the options that directly reflect a year back from April 15, 2023, we recognize we have misinterpreted. Recognizing that answers need to reflect back logically concludes to settle as April 15, 2020 in options against means we account incorrectly to evaluate otherwise since minute shifts directly fail to find but thus sole closest date is 2020.", "answer": "A", "score": 6.2543921463445455}
