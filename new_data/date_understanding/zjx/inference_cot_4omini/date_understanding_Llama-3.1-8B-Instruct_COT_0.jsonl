This means she ate 40 eggs in total. Since she ate one egg per day, she ate 40 eggs from May 9th, 2017, to the day she ran out of eggs.\n\nTo find the date she ran out of eggs, we need to count 40 days from May 9th, 2017. \n\nMay has 31 days, so from May 9th to May 31st, there are 22 days. \nJune has 30 days, so from June 1st to June 30th, there are 30 days. \nIn total, 22 + 30 = 52 days.

So, 29 days have passed in February.\n\nNow, let's add the total days passed: 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 29 = 324 days.\n\nHowever, we know that 176 days have passed since March 20, 2020. So, we need to subtract 176 from 324 to find the remaining days: 324 - 176 = 148 days.\n\nSince 148 days have passed from March 20, 2020, we need to find the date 148 days after March 20, 2020. \n\nMarch has 31 days, so 31 days have passed in March.\nApril has 30 days, so 30 days have passed in April.\nMay has 31 days, so 31 days have passed in May.\nJune has 30 days, so 30 days have passed in June.\nJuly has 31 days, so 31 days have passed in July.\nAugust has 31 days, so 31 days have passed in August.\nSeptember has 30 days, so 30 days have passed in September.\nOctober has 31 days, so 31 days have passed in October.\nNovember has 30 days, so 30 days have passed in November.\nDecember has 31 days, so 31 days have passed in December.\nJanuary has 31 days, so 31 days have passed in January.\nFebruary has 29 days in a leap year, so 29 days have passed in February.\n\nNow, let's add the total days passed: 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 29 = 364 days.\n\nSince 364 days have passed from March 20, 2020, we need to find the date 364 days after March 20, 2020.
