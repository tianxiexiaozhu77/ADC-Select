Today is her 16-year-old birthday, so we need to find the date 16 years after her birthdate.\n\nTo do this, we add 16 years to 02/28/2001:\n\n- 2001 + 10 years = 2011\n- 2011 + 5 years = 2016\n- 2016 + 1 year = 2017\n\nSo, the year is 2017. Now, we need to find the date 16 years after 02/28/2001 in the year 2017. Since 16 years have passed, we can simply add 16 to the day of the month (28) and see if it's still in February. \n\n28 + 16 = 44, which is greater than 28, so we need to carry over the extra days to the next month. February has 28 days, so we add 16 to 28 and get 44, then subtract 28 from 44 to get 16. Since 16 is less than 28, we can simply add 16 to the month (February) and get March.

Since 02/29/2000 is a leap day that occurs only every 4 years, we need to consider the years 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020 as possible birthdays.\n\nSince today is her 16-year-old birthday, we need to find the current year. We can do this by adding 16 to her birth year. \n\n2000 + 16 = 2016\n\nSo, today's year is 2016. However, since today is her 16-year-old birthday, we need to find the date 16 years ago from her birthdate. \n\n02/29/2000 + 16 years = 02/29/2016\n\nHowever, since 02/29/2016 is not a leap day, we need to consider the next leap day, which is 02/29/2020. Therefore, her 16-year-old birthday is actually on 02/29/2020.\n\nA month ago from 02/29/2020 would be 01/29/2020.\n\nTherefore, among A through F, the answer is (F)", 'idx': 249}
