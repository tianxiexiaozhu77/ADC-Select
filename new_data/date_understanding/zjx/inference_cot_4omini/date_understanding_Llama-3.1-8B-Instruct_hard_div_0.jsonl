Since February has 28 days (or 29 in a leap year), the last day of February in 2000 would be February 29th. However, since Jane is 16 years old today, we need to find the last day of February in 2016, which is February 29th. \n\nSince Jane is 16 years old today, we need to subtract 16 years from 2016 to find her birth year, which is 2000. \n\nNow, we need to find the date one year ago from today, which is 16 years old. Since Jane was born on February 29th, 2000, one year ago from today would be February 29th, 2015. However, February 29th only occurs every 4 years, so we need to find the closest date to February 29th in a non-leap year.\n\nThe closest date to February 29th in a non-leap year is February 28th.

Since 2015 is coming in 36 hours, we can subtract 2 days from the current date. \n\nHowever, we don't know the current date. But we can use the fact that 2015 is coming in 36 hours, which is 1.5 days. This means that the current date is 1.5 days before December 31, 2014.\n\nLet's count back 1.5 days from December 31, 2014:\n\nDecember 31, 2014 - 1 day = December 30, 2014\nDecember 30, 2014 - 0.5 days = December 29, 2014\n\nSo, the current date is December 29, 2014.\n\nNow, we can find the date one year ago from today:\n\nDecember 29, 2014 - 1 year = December 29, 2013\n\nHowever, this is not among the options.
