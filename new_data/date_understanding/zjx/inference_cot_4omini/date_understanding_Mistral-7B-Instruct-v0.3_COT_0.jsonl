Since a leap year has 366 days, and Jane was born on the last day of February, we can count the number of leap years that have passed since then.\n\n1. In 2004, there was no leap year, so we move to 2008 (4 years).\n2. In 2008, there was a leap year, so we move to 2012 (4 more years).\n3. In 2012, there was no leap year, so we move to 2016 (4 more years).\n4. In 2016, there was a leap year, so we move to 2020 (4 more years).\n\nNow, we have reached 2020, and we need to find the year in which Jane's 16th birthday falls. Since her birthday is on February 29, we need to find the next leap year after 2020. The next leap year is 2024.\n\nTo find the date of her 16th birthday, we need to count 365 days from February 29, 2024, since there are no leap years between 2024 and the year of her birthday.\n\n1. February 29, 2024, is a Thursday.\n2. Adding 365 days, we get March 28, 2025 (since there is no February 29 in a non-leap year).\n3. However, since Jane's birthday is on a February 29, we need to find the next occurrence of February 29 after March 28, 2025.\n4. The next February 29 falls on February 29, 2028.\n\nSince we have already counted 365 days from February 29, 2024, we need to add an additional 4 years (2028 - 2024) to account for the leap years that have passed since then.\n\nTherefore, the date of Jane's 16th birthday is February 29, 2032. However, the given options do not include this date.

Now, we subtract the 39 days from the day number (9 - 39 = -28), which gives us a negative number.

Therefore, none of the provided options is correct.\n\nHowever, if we consider the question's context that Jane saw a meteor shower for the second time in 1973, it is likely that the first time she saw a meteor shower was on a significant meteor shower date, such as the Perseids or Leonids. In that case, we can assume that the first meteor shower occurred on August 30, 1973 (Perseids peak) or November 17, 1973 (Leonids peak).\n\nIf we assume that the first meteor shower occurred on August 30, 1973, then the date 10 days ago would be July 30, 1973. However, this date is not provided in the options.\n\nIn conclusion, while the provided options do not include the correct date, the question's context suggests that the date 10 days ago might be July 30, 1973, but this is not explicitly stated in the question.", 'idx': 177}

If Jane ate one egg per day and ran out on the current day, that means she had one less egg than the number of days since she bought them. So, we subtract 40 (the number of eggs Jane bought) from the total number of days since then, which is 31 (the number of days in May, 2017). This gives us 31 - 40 = -7 days. However, since we cannot have a negative number of days, we subtract these 7 days from the first day after she bought the eggs, which is May 10th. So, the day a month ago would be May 10th - 7 days = May 3rd. Since the format is MM/DD/YYYY, we convert the day to a two-digit number (03) and get the answer as 05/03/2017.
