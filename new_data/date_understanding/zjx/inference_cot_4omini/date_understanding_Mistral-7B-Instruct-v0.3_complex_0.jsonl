After that, she would run out of eggs. So, to find the date she ran out of eggs, we subtract 40 from 41 (since she bought the eggs on the 9th and ate one on the 10th). That gives us 41 - 40 = 1. Therefore, she ran out of eggs on May 10th, 2017 plus 1 day, which is May 11th, 2017.\n\nYesterday's date would be one day before that, so it would be May 10th, 2017. Among the options given, the closest date is June 17th, 2017 (option B), but that is 40 days after May 9th, 2017, not one day before May 11th, 2017. Therefore, the answer is not among the given options.\n\nTo find the correct date, we would need to subtract 1 day from May 11th, 2017, which gives us May 10th, 2017.

If Jane's appointment is 3 days later, it would be on Apr 13, 1985. However, the question asks for the date 24 hours later. To find this, we add 24 hours to Apr 13, 1985.\n\nApril has 30 days, so Apr 13, 1985, is not the last day of the month. Therefore, adding 24 hours to Apr 13, 1985, will result in the same date, but with a different time. So, the question seems to have a mistake.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the question meant 24 hours after Apr 13, 1985, then we would need to subtract 24 hours from the start of the next day, which is midnight. So, the date would be Apr 14, 1985, at midnight.\n\nBut since the question seems to have a mistake, it's hard to provide a definitive answer. The correct answer should be either Apr 13, 1985, at 11:00 PM (if we consider the day as ending at midnight) or Apr 14, 1985, at 12:00 AM (if we consider the day as starting at midnight).\n\nAmong the options provided, none of them seem to match these possibilities, so it seems there might be an error in the question itself.", 'idx': 162}

To find the date 10 days ago, we subtract 10 days from the end of the year (December 31, 2014). So, 31 - 10 = 21 days remain in the year. Since there are 36 hours left in the year, we divide the remaining days by the number of hours in a day (24) to find the number of days left: 21 / 24 = approximately 0.875 days. Since we're looking for the date 10 days ago, we subtract this approximate number of days from December 31, 2014: 12/31/2014 - 0.875 days = approximately 12/29/2014.

To do this, we add 50 years to 1958, which gives us 2008. Then, we look for the date in January that is 50 years after Jan 2, 1958. Since there are 31 days in January, we add 50 to 2 (the day of the month) to get 52. However, since there are only 30 days in February, February 1, 1958 was not a leap year, and so there is no 52nd day in January in 2008. Instead, we should subtract 1 from 52 to get 51, and then add that to the day of the month (2) to get 53. Since there are only 31 days in January, the 53rd day of the year would be February 1. Therefore, the date of their golden wedding anniversary is February 1, 2008. However, the options provided do not include this date.
