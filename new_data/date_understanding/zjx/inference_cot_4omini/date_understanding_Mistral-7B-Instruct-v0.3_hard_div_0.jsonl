Then, she visited in November 2009, December 2009, January 2010, February 2010, and now it's her 5th visit, which means she has visited in March 2010.\n\nSo, she has visited for 5 months in 2010. Since there are 12 months in a year, she has also visited for 7 months in 2011 (from July to December).\n\nAdding these up, she has visited for a total of 17 months (10 + 7) from October 2009 to March 2011.\n\nSince there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many full years have passed by dividing the total number of months by 12. In this case, 17 months / 12 months per year = 1 year and 5 months.\n\nSo, she has visited for 1 year and 5 months from October 2009 to March 2011.

The end day of the year is 364 (since we're subtracting 36 hours from the start of the year).\n\nSo, the number of days between the start and end dates is:\n\n(2014 - 2015) * 365 + (364 - 0) = -365 + 364 = -1\n\nSince we're counting backwards from the start date, this means the date 10 days ago is one day before the start date, which is December 31, 2014.\n\nTherefore, among A through F, the answer is (B) 12/31/2014.", 'idx': 164}
