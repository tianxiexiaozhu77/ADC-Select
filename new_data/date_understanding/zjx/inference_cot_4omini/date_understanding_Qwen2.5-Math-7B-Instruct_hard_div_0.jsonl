Mar 20, 2020.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of days in each month from Mar 20 to Mar 31:**\n   - March has 31 days.\n   - Days from Mar 20 to Mar 31: \\( 31 - 20 + 1 = 12 \\) days.\n\n2. **Subtract these 12 days from 176 days:**\n   \\[\n   176 - 12 = 164 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the remaining days to subtract from the previous year:**\n   - Since 164 days is more than the number of days in a month, we need to consider the previous year.\n   - Days in a non-leap year: 365 days.\n   - Days in a leap year: 366 days.\n\n4. **Check if 2019 is a leap year:**\n   - 2019 is not a leap year (not divisible by 4).\n\n5. **Subtract 164 days from 2019:**\n   - First, subtract 12 days from the remaining days in the year.\n   - Days remaining in the year after March: \\( 365 - 12 = 353 \\) days.\n   - Subtract 164 days from 353 days: \\( 353 - 164 = 189 \\) days.\n\n6. **Determine the date 189 days before Mar 20, 2020:**\n   - Since 189 days is more than the number of days in a month, we need to consider the previous year again.\n   - Days in a non-leap year: 365 days.\n   - Days in a leap year: 366 days.\n\n7. **Subtract 189 days from 2019:**\n   - First, subtract 12 days from the remaining days in the year.\n   - Days remaining in the year after March: \\( 365 - 12 = 353 \\) days.\n   - Subtract 164 days from 353 days: \\( 353 - 164 = 189 \\) days.\n\n8. **Determine

The given date is 8/3/1997. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the month and day**: The month is August and the day is 3.\n2. **Subtract 7 days from the day**: Since 3 is less than 7, we need to go back to the previous month (July) and add the remaining days to the last day of July.\n3. **Calculate the remaining days**: We need to subtract 3 days from 7, which gives us 4 days. So, we add 4 days to the last day of July, which is 31.\n4. **Add the days**: 31 + 4 = 35. Since 35 is more than 31, we need to subtract 31 from 35, which gives us 4 days. So, we add 4 days to the last day of June, which is 30.\n5. **Add the days**: 30 + 4 = 34. Since 34 is more than 31, we need to subtract 31 from 34, which gives us 3 days. So, we add 3 days to the last day of May, which is 31.\n6. **Add the days**: 31 + 3 = 34. Since 34 is more than 31, we need to subtract 31 from 34, which gives us 3 days. So, we add 3 days to the last day of April, which is 30.\n7. **Add the days**: 30 + 3 = 33. Since 33 is more than 31, we need to subtract 31 from 33, which gives us 2 days. So, we add 2 days to the last day of March, which is 31.\n8. **Add the days**: 31 + 2 = 33. Since 33 is more than 31, we need to subtract 31 from 33, which gives us 2 days. So, we add 2 days to the last day of February, which is 28.\n9. **Add the days**: 28 + 2 = 30. Since 30 is more than 28, we need to subtract 28 from 30, which gives us 2 days. So, we add 2 days to the last day of January, which is 31.\n10. **Add the days**: 31 + 2 = 33. Since 33 is more than 31, we need to subtract 31 from 33, which gives us 2 days.

Since today is the first Monday of 2019, it is a Monday.\n\nNext, we add one week (7 days) to today's date. Since today is Monday, adding 7 days will bring us to the following Monday.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Today is Monday, 2019.\n2. One week from today will be Monday, 2019 + 7 days = Monday, 2019 + 1 week = Monday, 2019 + 7 days.\n\nTo find the exact date, we need to determine the day of the week for the first Monday of 2019 and then add 7 days to it.\n\nThe first Monday of 2019 is January 7th.

Identify the current date.\n2. Subtract one year from the current date.\n\nGiven that today is the US Thanksgiving of 2001, we know that it falls on the fourth Thursday of November. To find the date one year ago, we subtract one year from 2001, which gives us 2000.\n\nNext, we need to determine the fourth Thursday of November in 2000. We can do this by finding the first Thursday of November 2000 and then adding three weeks to it.\n\nFirst, let's find the first Thursday of November 2000. We can use a calendar or a calculator to determine this. The first Thursday of November 2000 is November 2nd.\n\nNow, we add three weeks to November 2nd:\n- One week after November 2nd is November 9th.\n- Two weeks after November 2nd is November 16th.\n- Three weeks after November 2nd is November 23rd.\n\nTherefore, the fourth Thursday of November 2000 is November 23rd.\n\nSo, the date one year ago from today (Thanksgiving of 2001) is November 23rd, 2000.\n\nHowever, the options provided do not include November 23rd, 2000.

Since 176 days have passed since Mar 20, 2020, we need to add 176 days to Mar 20, 2020.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of days remaining in March 2020:**\n   - March has 31 days.\n   - Days remaining in March: \\(31 - 20 = 11\\)\n\n2. **Calculate the number of days in the remaining months:**\n   - April has 30 days.\n   - May has 31 days.\n   - June has 30 days.\n   - July has 31 days.\n   - August has 31 days.\n   - September has 30 days.\n   - October has 31 days.\n   - November has 30 days.\n   - December has 31 days.\n\n   Total days in these months: \\(30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 = 304\\)\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of days from Mar 20, 2020, to Mar 20, 2021:**\n   - Total days in 2020: \\(366\\) (since 2020 is a leap year)\n   - Days from Mar 20, 2020, to Mar 20, 2021: \\(366\\)\n\n4. **Calculate the number of days from Mar 20, 2021, to the given date:**\n   - Total days from Mar 20, 2020, to the given date: \\(176\\)\n   - Days from Mar 20, 2020, to Mar 20, 2021: \\(366\\)\n   - Days from Mar 20, 2021, to the given date: \\(176 - 366 = -190\\)\n\n   This calculation is incorrect.
