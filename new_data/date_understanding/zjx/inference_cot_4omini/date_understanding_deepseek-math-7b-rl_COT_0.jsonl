The number of days that have passed since the start of the year on 03/20/2020 is 31 (for March) + 20 = 51.\n\nAdding 176 to 51 gives 227. To find the month and day corresponding to this number of days into the year, we need to subtract multiples of 365 (the number of days in a non-leap year) or 366 (the number of days in a leap year) from 227 until we get a number less than 366.\n\n227 is less than 366, so we don't need to subtract anything. Now we need to find the month and day corresponding to the 227th day into the year.\n\nThere are 31 days in March, so we subtract 31 from 227 to get 196. The next month, April, has 30 days. Subtracting 30 from 196 gives 166. The next month, May, has 31 days. Subtracting 31 from 166 gives 135. The next month, June, has 30 days. Subtracting 30 from 135 gives 105. The next month, July, has 31 days. Subtracting 31 from 105 gives 74. The next month, August, has 31 days. Subtracting 31 from 74 gives 43. The next month, September, has 30 days. Subtracting 30 from 43 gives 13. September 13th is the 176th day after 03/20/2020.\n\nThe next day, September 14th, is the 177th day after 03/20/2020.

The number of days that have passed since the start of the year on 03/20/2020 is 31 (for March) + 20 = 51.\n\nAdding 176 to 51 gives 227. To find the month and day corresponding to this number of days into the year, we need to subtract multiples of 365 (the number of days in a non-leap year) or 366 (the number of days in a leap year) until we get a number less than 366.\n\nSince 227 is less than 366, we don't need to make any adjustments. Now we need to convert the number of days into a month and day.\n\nThere are 31 days in March, so we subtract 31 from 227: 227 - 31 = 196.\n\nThere are 28 days in April, so we subtract 28 from 196: 196 - 28 = 168.\n\nThere are 31 days in May, so we subtract 31 from 168: 168 - 31 = 137.\n\nThere are 30 days in June, so we subtract 30 from 137: 137 - 30 = 107.\n\nThere are 31 days in July, so we subtract 31 from 107: 107 - 31 = 76.\n\nThere are 31 days in August, so we subtract 31 from 76: 76 - 31 = 45.\n\nThere are 31 days in September, so we subtract 31 from 45: 45 - 31 = 14.\n\nThere are 14 days in September. So, 176 days after 03/20/2020 is 09/14/2020.\n\nHowever, the given options do not have 09/14/2020 as an option. This indicates that there might be an error in our calculation. Let's retrace our steps and find the error.\n\nWe calculated that there were 51 days that had passed since the start of the year on 03/20/2020. However, we should have calculated the number of days that had passed since the start of the previous year (2019) and added the number of days in 2020 up to 03/20/2020.\n\nThe number of days that had passed since the start of 2019 on 03/20/2020 is 365 (the number of days in 2019) + 51 = 416.\n\nNow, let's add 176 to this: 416 + 176 = 592.\n\nHowever, 592 is greater than 366 (the number of days in 2020), so we need to subtract 366 from it: 592 - 366 = 226.\n\nNow, let's convert this number of days into a month and day.\n\nThere are 31 days in March, so we subtract 31 from 226: 226 - 31 = 195.\n\nThere are 28 days in April, so we subtract 28 from 195: 195 - 28 = 167.\n\nThere are 31 days in May, so we subtract 31 from 167: 167 - 31 = 136.\n\nThere are 30 days in June, so we subtract 30 from 136: 136 - 30 = 106.\n\nThere are 31 days in July, so we subtract 31 from 106: 106 - 31 = 75.\n\nThere are 31 days in August, so we subtract 31 from 75: 75 - 31 = 44.\n\nThere are 31 days in September, so we subtract 31 from 44: 44 - 31 = 13.\n\nThere are 13 days in September. So, 176 days after 03/20/2020 is 09/13/2020.\n\nHowever, the given options do not have 09/13/2020 as an option. This indicates that there might be another error in our calculation.
