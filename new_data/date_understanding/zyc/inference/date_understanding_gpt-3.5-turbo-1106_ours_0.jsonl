Since today is her 16-year-old birthday, we need to account for leap years. The previous leap year was 2016, so her birthday last occurred on February 29th, 2016. Therefore, yesterday's date would be February 28th, 2016.\nTherefore, among A through F, the answer is (B)\n\nQ: Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2001. Today is her 16-year-old birthday.
