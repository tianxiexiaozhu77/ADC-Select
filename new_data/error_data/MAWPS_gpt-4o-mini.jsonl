{"prompt": "Q: It has been tradition in Shiela’s home to hang a sock above the fireplace for each member of the family. This year, she placed a cinnamon ball every day in the socks for 5 of her family members. How long can she do this if she bought 50 cinnamon balls?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nShiela has 5 family members and each member receives a cinnamon ball every day. We need to find out how many days she can continue placing cinnamon balls in the socks with a total of 50 cinnamon balls. First, we calculate the total number of cinnamon balls used per day: 5 (family members) x 1 (cinnamon ball per member) = 5 cinnamon balls per day. Now, to find out how many days she can do this, we divide the total cinnamon balls by the number of balls used per day: 50 (total cinnamon balls) ÷ 5 (cinnamon balls used per day) = 10 days. Therefore, she can hang cinnamon balls in the socks for 10 days.\nTherefore, the answer is (10.0)\n\nQ: Oliver is at the library helping put away books. There are 46 book to put away total but a librarian takes 10 of them and leaves Oliver with the rest. If he can fit 4 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many books Oliver has left after the librarian takes 10 books. So, we subtract the 10 books taken by the librarian from the total 46 books. That gives us 46 - 10 = 36 books left. Next, we need to determine how many shelves Oliver requires, given that he can fit 4 books on each shelf. We divide the number of books by the capacity of each shelf, which is 36 / 4. This division results in 9. Since 9 is a whole number, Oliver will need exactly 9 shelves to put away the 36 books.\nTherefore, the answer is (9.0)\n\nQ: Jerry is at the library helping put away books. There are 34 book to put away total but a librarian takes 7 of them and leaves Jerry with the rest. If he can fit 3 books on a shelf, how many shelves will he need?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many books Jerry has left after the librarian takes some. We start with 34 books and subtract the 7 taken by the librarian:\n\n34 - 7 = 27.\n\nNow, Jerry has 27 books to put away. Next, we need to find out how many shelves he needs if he can fit 3 books on each shelf. To find this, we divide the total number of books Jerry has by the number of books he can fit on one shelf:\n\n27 / 3 = 9.\n\nSince 27 is exactly divisible by 3, Jerry will need exactly 9 shelves to put away all 27 books.\nTherefore, the answer is (9.0)\n\nQ: Jane had been saving large empty cans to serve as pots for sunflowers. If she has 54 sunflower seeds and there are 9 cans, how many seeds will be placed in each can if she places an equal number of seeds in each can?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many sunflower seeds Jane can place in each can, we need to divide the total number of sunflower seeds by the number of cans. Jane has 54 sunflower seeds and 9 cans. The calculation involves dividing 54 by 9. Performing the division, we find: 54 ÷ 9 = 6. Hence, Jane can place 6 seeds in each can, making sure that each can has an equal amount.

If every sack can contain around 20 pieces of wood, how many sacks were they able to fill if they gathered 80 pieces of wood?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that each sack can hold 20 pieces of wood. To determine how many sacks they can fill with the wood collected, we take the total pieces of wood gathered (80 pieces) and divide it by the capacity of one sack (20 pieces). This gives us the equation: Number of sacks = Total pieces of wood / Pieces per sack = 80 / 20 = 4. Since we are not dealing with fractional sacks in this scenario, we conclude they filled 4 sacks completely.\nTherefore, the answer is (4.0)\n\nQ: A store had 40 coloring books in stock.

They then organized the remaining 20 coloring books on shelves, with each shelf holding 4 coloring books. To find out how many shelves they used, we divide the total number of coloring books by the number of books per shelf: 20 ÷ 4 = 5. Therefore, they used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the answer is (5.0)\n\nQ: Brenda, Betty’s sister, wanted to have 3 bracelets with star-shaped stones. She also bought 36 star-shaped stones from the local store and gave it to Betty.

To find out how many stones will be in each bracelet, we need to divide the total number of stones by the number of bracelets. So, we calculate 36 divided by 3. This gives us 12 stones per bracelet. Therefore, the answer is (12).\nTherefore, the answer is (12.0)\n\nQ: Paula's aunt gave her $109 to spend on clothes at the mall. She bought 2 shirts that cost $11 each and a pair of pants that cost $13. How much money does Paula have left to buy more clothes?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaula's aunt gave her $109. First, we calculate the total cost of the shirts: she bought 2 shirts at $11 each, which totals 2 * 11 = $22. Next, she bought a pair of pants for $13. Therefore, the total expenses are $22 (for the shirts) + $13 (for the pants) = $35. To find out how much money Paula has left, we subtract the total expenses from the initial amount given by her aunt: $109 - $35 = $74. Thus, Paula has $74 left to buy more clothes.\nTherefore, the answer is (74.0)\n\nQuestion: Melanie is selling 4 gumballs for eight cents each.

To find this, we divide the total number of books Jerry has by the number of books he can fit on one shelf:\n\n27 / 3 = 9.\n\nSince 27 is exactly divisible by 3, Jerry will need exactly 9 shelves to put away all 27 books.\nTherefore, the answer is (9.0)\n\nQ: Jane had been saving large empty cans to serve as pots for sunflowers. If she has 54 sunflower seeds and there are 9 cans, how many seeds will be placed in each can if she places an equal number of seeds in each can?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many sunflower seeds Jane can place in each can, we need to divide the total number of sunflower seeds by the number of cans. Jane has 54 sunflower seeds and 9 cans. The calculation involves dividing 54 by 9. Performing the division, we find: 54 ÷ 9 = 6. Hence, Jane can place 6 seeds in each can, making sure that each can has an equal amount. Therefore, the answer is (6).\nTherefore, the answer is (6.0)\n\nQ: Christian’s father and the senior ranger gathered firewood as they walked towards the lake in the park and brought with them sacks. If every sack can contain around 20 pieces of wood, how many sacks were they able to fill if they gathered 80 pieces of wood?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that each sack can hold 20 pieces of wood. To determine how many sacks they can fill with the wood collected, we take the total pieces of wood gathered (80 pieces) and divide it by the capacity of one sack (20 pieces). This gives us the equation: Number of sacks = Total pieces of wood / Pieces per sack = 80 / 20 = 4. Since we are not dealing with fractional sacks in this scenario, we conclude they filled 4 sacks completely.\nTherefore, the answer is (4.0)\n\nQ: A store had 40 coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 20 of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 4 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe store initially had 40 coloring books. They sold 20 of them, leaving them with 40 - 20 = 20 coloring books. They then organized the remaining 20 coloring books on shelves, with each shelf holding 4 coloring books. To find out how many shelves they used, we divide the total number of coloring books by the number of books per shelf: 20 ÷ 4 = 5. Therefore, they used 5 shelves.\nTherefore, the answer is (5.0)\n\nQ: Brenda, Betty’s sister, wanted to have 3 bracelets with star-shaped stones. She also bought 36 star-shaped stones from the local store and gave it to Betty. How many star-shaped stones will there be in each of the bracelet Betty makes for Brenda?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nBrenda wants to make 3 bracelets and she has 36 star-shaped stones to use for these bracelets. To find out how many stones will be in each bracelet, we need to divide the total number of stones by the number of bracelets. So, we calculate 36 divided by 3. This gives us 12 stones per bracelet. Therefore, the answer is (12).\nTherefore, the answer is (12.0)\n\nQ: Paula's aunt gave her $109 to spend on clothes at the mall. She bought 2 shirts that cost $11 each and a pair of pants that cost $13. How much money does Paula have left to buy more clothes?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaula's aunt gave her $109. First, we calculate the total cost of the shirts: she bought 2 shirts at $11 each, which totals 2 * 11 = $22. Next, she bought a pair of pants for $13. Therefore, the total expenses are $22 (for the shirts) + $13 (for the pants) = $35. To find out how much money Paula has left, we subtract the total expenses from the initial amount given by her aunt: $109 - $35 = $74. Thus, Paula has $74 left to buy more clothes.\nTherefore, the answer is (74.0)\n\nQuestion: Bianca's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total.

{"prompt": "Q: It has been tradition in Shiela’s home to hang a sock above the fireplace for each member of the family. This year, she placed a cinnamon ball every day in the socks for 5 of her family members. How long can she do this if she bought 50 cinnamon balls?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nShiela has 5 family members and each member receives a cinnamon ball every day. We need to find out how many days she can continue placing cinnamon balls in the socks with a total of 50 cinnamon balls. First, we calculate the total number of cinnamon balls used per day: 5 (family members) x 1 (cinnamon ball per member) = 5 cinnamon balls per day. Now, to find out how many days she can do this, we divide the total cinnamon balls by the number of balls used per day: 50 (total cinnamon balls) ÷ 5 (cinnamon balls used per day) = 10 days.

She bought 2 shirts that cost $11 each and a pair of pants that cost $13. How much money does Paula have left to buy more clothes?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaula's aunt gave her $109.
