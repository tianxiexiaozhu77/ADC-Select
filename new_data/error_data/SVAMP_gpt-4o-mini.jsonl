{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices.

How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: There were 2 roses in the vase.

The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework.

Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: Lewis earns $ 28 every week during the 1091 weeks of harvest.

Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: Zachary did 53 push-ups and 14 crunches in gym class today.

How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday.

Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest.

We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed.

Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: There are 10 different books and 6 different movies in the ' crazy silly school ' series.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed.

Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers.

Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: During summer break 644997 kids from Lawrence county stayed home and the other 893835 kids went to camp.

How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: A farmer had 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums.

Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: Lewis earns $ 368 every week during the 1359 weeks of harvest.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book.

That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: Dan has $ 4.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book.

How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary in gym class today.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book.

Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: Frank was reading through his favorite book.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book.

Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold.

How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book.

Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold.

How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book.

If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices.

How many more raisin cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 300 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 280 raisin cookies. Now, we will subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday: 300 - 280 = 20. This tells us that Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: After a typhoon, 13 trees in Haley's backyard died. If she had grown 3 trees initially.

There, Rachel learned that 661 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 600 visitors the previous day. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the current day compared to the previous day, we start by noting the number of visitors for each day. The current day had 661 visitors, and the previous day had 600 visitors. We need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number on the current day: 661 - 600 = 61.

Yesterday, Helen baked 300 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 280 raisin cookies. Now, we will subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday: 300 - 280 = 20. This tells us that Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested bacon be denoted as x. According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: Rachel had to complete 2 pages of math homework, 3 pages of reading homework and 10 more pages of biology homework.

{"prompt": "Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There were 39 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 661 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 600 visitors the previous day. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the current day compared to the previous day, we start by noting the number of visitors for each day. The current day had 661 visitors, and the previous day had 600 visitors. We need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number on the current day: 661 - 600 = 61. Thus, there were 61 more visitors on that day than on the previous day.\nTherefore, the answer is (61.0)\n\nQ: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the day in question compared to the previous 245 days, we first need to calculate the total number of visitors over those days. This can be achieved by averaging the known visitors over the previous three days, assuming that they represent a reasonable estimate of visitor numbers for the 245 days prior.\n\n1. Visitors on Day X (the day in question) = 705\n2. Visitors the previous day (Day X-1) = 191\n3. Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house.

This tells us that Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested bacon be denoted as x. According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: For Gwen's birthday she received 8 dollars from her mom. Her dad gave her 5 more dollars. If she spent 4 dollars.

There, Rachel learned that 661 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 600 visitors the previous day. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the current day compared to the previous day, we start by noting the number of visitors for each day. The current day had 661 visitors, and the previous day had 600 visitors. We need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number on the current day: 661 - 600 = 61. Thus, there were 61 more visitors on that day than on the previous day.\nTherefore, the answer is (61.0)\n\nQ: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the day in question compared to the previous 245 days, we first need to calculate the total number of visitors over those days. This can be achieved by averaging the known visitors over the previous three days, assuming that they represent a reasonable estimate of visitor numbers for the 245 days prior.\n\n1. Visitors on Day X (the day in question) = 705\n2. Visitors the previous day (Day X-1) = 191\n3. Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house.

There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

There, Rachel learned that 661 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 600 visitors the previous day. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the current day compared to the previous day, we start by noting the number of visitors for each day. The current day had 661 visitors, and the previous day had 600 visitors. We need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number on the current day: 661 - 600 = 61. Thus, there were 61 more visitors on that day than on the previous day.\nTherefore, the answer is (61.0)\n\nQ: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the day in question compared to the previous 245 days, we first need to calculate the total number of visitors over those days. This can be achieved by averaging the known visitors over the previous three days, assuming that they represent a reasonable estimate of visitor numbers for the 245 days prior.\n\n1. Visitors on Day X (the day in question) = 705\n2. Visitors the previous day (Day X-1) = 191\n3. Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house.

There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348.

There, Rachel learned that 661 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 600 visitors the previous day. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the current day compared to the previous day, we start by noting the number of visitors for each day. The current day had 661 visitors, and the previous day had 600 visitors. We need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number on the current day: 661 - 600 = 61. Thus, there were 61 more visitors on that day than on the previous day.\nTherefore, the answer is (61.0)\n\nQ: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the day in question compared to the previous 245 days, we first need to calculate the total number of visitors over those days. This can be achieved by averaging the known visitors over the previous three days, assuming that they represent a reasonable estimate of visitor numbers for the 245 days prior.\n\n1. Visitors on Day X (the day in question) = 705\n2. Visitors the previous day (Day X-1) = 191\n3. Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house.

How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: Lewis earns $ 28 every week during the 1091 weeks of harvest. He also earns $ 939 per week for working overtime.

{"prompt": "Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There were 39 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 661 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 600 visitors the previous day. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the current day compared to the previous day, we start by noting the number of visitors for each day. The current day had 661 visitors, and the previous day had 600 visitors. We need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number on the current day: 661 - 600 = 61. Thus, there were 61 more visitors on that day than on the previous day.\nTherefore, the answer is (61.0)\n\nQ: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the day in question compared to the previous 245 days, we first need to calculate the total number of visitors over those days. This can be achieved by averaging the known visitors over the previous three days, assuming that they represent a reasonable estimate of visitor numbers for the 245 days prior.\n\n1. Visitors on Day X (the day in question) = 705\n2. Visitors the previous day (Day X-1) = 191\n3. Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house.

How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: Emily is making bead necklaces for her friends. She had 2 beads and she was able to make 32 necklaces.

{"prompt": "Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There were 39 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 661 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 600 visitors the previous day. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the current day compared to the previous day, we start by noting the number of visitors for each day. The current day had 661 visitors, and the previous day had 600 visitors. We need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number on the current day: 661 - 600 = 61. Thus, there were 61 more visitors on that day than on the previous day.\nTherefore, the answer is (61.0)\n\nQ: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the day in question compared to the previous 245 days, we first need to calculate the total number of visitors over those days. This can be achieved by averaging the known visitors over the previous three days, assuming that they represent a reasonable estimate of visitor numbers for the 245 days prior.\n\n1. Visitors on Day X (the day in question) = 705\n2. Visitors the previous day (Day X-1) = 191\n3. Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house.

How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: 6 birds were sitting on the fence. 4 more birds and 8 more storks came to join them.

{"prompt": "Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There were 39 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 661 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 600 visitors the previous day. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the current day compared to the previous day, we start by noting the number of visitors for each day. The current day had 661 visitors, and the previous day had 600 visitors. We need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number on the current day: 661 - 600 = 61. Thus, there were 61 more visitors on that day than on the previous day.\nTherefore, the answer is (61.0)\n\nQ: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the day in question compared to the previous 245 days, we first need to calculate the total number of visitors over those days. This can be achieved by averaging the known visitors over the previous three days, assuming that they represent a reasonable estimate of visitor numbers for the 245 days prior.\n\n1. Visitors on Day X (the day in question) = 705\n2. Visitors the previous day (Day X-1) = 191\n3. Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house.

How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds.

{"prompt": "Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There were 39 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 661 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 600 visitors the previous day. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the current day compared to the previous day, we start by noting the number of visitors for each day. The current day had 661 visitors, and the previous day had 600 visitors. We need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number on the current day: 661 - 600 = 61. Thus, there were 61 more visitors on that day than on the previous day.\nTherefore, the answer is (61.0)\n\nQ: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the day in question compared to the previous 245 days, we first need to calculate the total number of visitors over those days. This can be achieved by averaging the known visitors over the previous three days, assuming that they represent a reasonable estimate of visitor numbers for the 245 days prior.\n\n1. Visitors on Day X (the day in question) = 705\n2. Visitors the previous day (Day X-1) = 191\n3. Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house.

Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. Now we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today from those baked yesterday to find out how many more she baked yesterday compared to today.

How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: Bobby ate 28 pieces of candy. Then he ate 42 more. He also ate 63 pieces of chocolate.

{"prompt": "Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There were 39 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 661 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 600 visitors the previous day. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the current day compared to the previous day, we start by noting the number of visitors for each day. The current day had 661 visitors, and the previous day had 600 visitors. We need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number on the current day: 661 - 600 = 61. Thus, there were 61 more visitors on that day than on the previous day.\nTherefore, the answer is (61.0)\n\nQ: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the day in question compared to the previous 245 days, we first need to calculate the total number of visitors over those days. This can be achieved by averaging the known visitors over the previous three days, assuming that they represent a reasonable estimate of visitor numbers for the 245 days prior.\n\n1. Visitors on Day X (the day in question) = 705\n2. Visitors the previous day (Day X-1) = 191\n3. Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house.

How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

{"prompt": "Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There were 39 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 661 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 600 visitors the previous day. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the current day compared to the previous day, we start by noting the number of visitors for each day. The current day had 661 visitors, and the previous day had 600 visitors. We need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number on the current day: 661 - 600 = 61. Thus, there were 61 more visitors on that day than on the previous day.\nTherefore, the answer is (61.0)\n\nQ: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the day in question compared to the previous 245 days, we first need to calculate the total number of visitors over those days. This can be achieved by averaging the known visitors over the previous three days, assuming that they represent a reasonable estimate of visitor numbers for the 245 days prior.\n\n1. Visitors on Day X (the day in question) = 705\n2. Visitors the previous day (Day X-1) = 191\n3. Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house.

How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: A farmer had 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden. If he picked 172 potatoes.

{"prompt": "Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There were 39 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 661 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 600 visitors the previous day. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the current day compared to the previous day, we start by noting the number of visitors for each day. The current day had 661 visitors, and the previous day had 600 visitors. We need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number on the current day: 661 - 600 = 61. Thus, there were 61 more visitors on that day than on the previous day.\nTherefore, the answer is (61.0)\n\nQ: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the day in question compared to the previous 245 days, we first need to calculate the total number of visitors over those days. This can be achieved by averaging the known visitors over the previous three days, assuming that they represent a reasonable estimate of visitor numbers for the 245 days prior.\n\n1. Visitors on Day X (the day in question) = 705\n2. Visitors the previous day (Day X-1) = 191\n3. Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house.

How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: If Lewis earns $ 1357 every week during the 223 weeks of a harvest season.

{"prompt": "Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There were 39 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 661 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 600 visitors the previous day. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the current day compared to the previous day, we start by noting the number of visitors for each day. The current day had 661 visitors, and the previous day had 600 visitors. We need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number on the current day: 661 - 600 = 61. Thus, there were 61 more visitors on that day than on the previous day.\nTherefore, the answer is (61.0)\n\nQ: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the day in question compared to the previous 245 days, we first need to calculate the total number of visitors over those days. This can be achieved by averaging the known visitors over the previous three days, assuming that they represent a reasonable estimate of visitor numbers for the 245 days prior.\n\n1. Visitors on Day X (the day in question) = 705\n2. Visitors the previous day (Day X-1) = 191\n3. Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house.

Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary in gym class today. If David did 38 push-ups.

{"prompt": "Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There were 39 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 661 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 600 visitors the previous day. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the current day compared to the previous day, we start by noting the number of visitors for each day. The current day had 661 visitors, and the previous day had 600 visitors. We need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number on the current day: 661 - 600 = 61. Thus, there were 61 more visitors on that day than on the previous day.\nTherefore, the answer is (61.0)\n\nQ: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the day in question compared to the previous 245 days, we first need to calculate the total number of visitors over those days. This can be achieved by averaging the known visitors over the previous three days, assuming that they represent a reasonable estimate of visitor numbers for the 245 days prior.\n\n1. Visitors on Day X (the day in question) = 705\n2. Visitors the previous day (Day X-1) = 191\n3. Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. Now we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today from those baked yesterday to find out how many more she baked yesterday compared to today.

Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 2 chapters each with 405 pages.

{"prompt": "Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There were 39 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 661 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 600 visitors the previous day. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the current day compared to the previous day, we start by noting the number of visitors for each day. The current day had 661 visitors, and the previous day had 600 visitors. We need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number on the current day: 661 - 600 = 61. Thus, there were 61 more visitors on that day than on the previous day.\nTherefore, the answer is (61.0)\n\nQ: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that. How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the day in question compared to the previous 245 days, we first need to calculate the total number of visitors over those days. This can be achieved by averaging the known visitors over the previous three days, assuming that they represent a reasonable estimate of visitor numbers for the 245 days prior.\n\n1. Visitors on Day X (the day in question) = 705\n2. Visitors the previous day (Day X-1) = 191\n3. Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. Now we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today from those baked yesterday to find out how many more she baked yesterday compared to today.

{"prompt": "Q: Liam has 130 baseball cards. He uses 45 cards to complete a set and 30 cards to trade with friends. How many more baseball cards did he use to complete the set than he did to trade with friends?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLiam used 45 baseball cards to complete a set and 30 cards to trade with friends. To find out how many more cards he used to complete the set than to trade, we need to subtract the number of trading cards from the number of cards used to complete the set.

After giving some to her cousin, she now owns 250 items left. How many more dolls than bears does Alice have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Alice had 300 dolls and 200 bears, making a total of 500 items. After giving some away, she has 250 items left. This means Alice gave away 500 - 250 = 250 items. Let D be the number of dolls Alice has left and B be the number of bears she has left. The total of the remaining dolls and bears is given by the equation D + B = 250. Since she started with 300 dolls, the number of dolls she gave away is 300 - D. Similarly, since she started with 200 bears, the number of bears she gave away is 200 - B. The difference between the remaining dolls and bears is given by the equation D - B. To find how many more dolls than bears Alice has, we can also express this in terms of how many she gave away. But in order to solve for any specific deal, we only need the relationship of the items left. Therefore, the exact numbers of dolls and bears left are D = 250 + (200 - B) and B + D = 250. Without knowing B directly, we can see the breakdown of their differences leads to understanding how many more dolls she has than bears ultimately by calculating D - B directly after establishing initial distributions.\nTherefore, the answer is (50)\n\nQ: Anna got a box of 130 crayons for her birthday. Throughout the school year, she donated 60 crayons to a charity while she lost 100 crayons. How many more crayons did she lose than those she donated?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we find the total number of crayons Anna lost, which is stated as 100. Next, we look at the number of crayons she donated to charity, which is 60. To find out how many more crayons she lost than those she donated, we perform the subtraction: 100 (lost) - 60 (donated) = 40. This means Anna lost 40 more crayons than she donated.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: Mike collects model cars. He had 520 cars and 410 trucks. After trading some with Peter, he is left with 410 vehicles. How many more model cars than trucks does Mike have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMike initially had a total of 520 model cars and 410 trucks, which sums up to 930 vehicles. After trading with Peter, he has 410 vehicles remaining. This means a total of 930 - 410 = 520 vehicles were traded away. Let x represent the number of cars Mike has left after the trade and y represent the number of trucks left after the trade. The total number of vehicles Mike has after the trade is x + y = 410. Mike originally had 520 cars and traded away (520 - x) cars, and he had 410 trucks and traded away (410 - y) trucks. Therefore, we also know that (520 - x) + (410 - y) = 520, simplifying to 520 - x + 410 - y = 520, which leads to x + y = 410. We need to find the difference, x - y. Given x + y = 410 and the total number of cars and trucks initially, Mike had more cars than trucks. We know that x + y = 410 helps guide our understanding of the distribution after trades but we cannot ascertain the specific breakdown without additional information about how many were traded. Therefore, we can conclude the number of model cars is still greater than the number of trucks. Since the number of model cars reduced from 520 and trucks from 410, let's consider that Mike always has more cars than trucks. Therefore, the difference cannot be determined without specific vehicle counts post-trade but is logically more than 0. Thus, knowing that Mike originally had 110 more cars than trucks (520 - 410), and he traded some of them but is left with more cars than trucks, it can be estimated that he likely has a minimum of 200 cars left compared to 210 trucks. Ultimately, we need to conclude that Mike has at least 10 more cars than trucks regardless of how many he ended up trading away.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Tom has a collection of stamps. Initially, he owned 125 vintage stamps and 190 modern stamps. After giving some to Sara, he has 215 stamps left. How many more vintage stamps than modern stamps does Tom have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTom initially has 125 vintage stamps and 190 modern stamps, totaling 125 + 190 = 315 stamps. After giving some to Sara, he has 215 stamps left. This means he has given away 315 - 215 = 100 stamps. Let the number of vintage stamps he gave to Sara be v and the number of modern stamps be m. Hence, v + m = 100. After giving away the stamps, Tom has 125 - v vintage stamps and 190 - m modern stamps. To find the difference between the vintage and modern stamps left, we need to calculate: (125 - v) - (190 - m) = (125 - v) - 190 + m = (m - v) - 65. We also know that m = 100 - v from the first equation, so substituting this into the difference calculation gives us: ((100 - v) - v) - 65 = 100 - 2v - 65 = 35 - 2v. This difference now depends on the value of v. In particular, the more vintage stamps v he gives away, the more modern stamps he keeps, and vice versa.\nTherefore, the answer is (35)\n\nQ: Jack was gifted a collection of 200 marbles for his birthday. During the summer, he gave away 50 marbles to his neighbors while he lost 125 marbles. How many more marbles did he lose than those he gave away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nJack initially had 200 marbles. He gave away 50 marbles to his neighbors. Then, he lost 125 marbles. To find out how many more marbles he lost than those he gave away, we subtract the number of marbles given away from the number of marbles lost: 125 (lost) - 50 (given away) = 75. Therefore, he lost 75 more marbles than he gave away.\nTherefore, the answer is (75)\n\nQ: Laura was given a collection of 95 toy cars for her birthday. Throughout the month, she handed 35 toy cars to her siblings while she lost 78 toy cars. How many more toy cars did she lose than the ones she handed out?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many toy cars Laura handed out and how many she lost. Laura handed out a total of 35 toy cars to her siblings. She lost 78 toy cars. To find out how many more toy cars she lost than she handed out, we calculate the difference between the number of toy cars she lost and the number she handed out: 78 (lost) - 35 (handed out) = 43. Therefore, Laura lost 43 more toy cars than she handed out.\nTherefore, the answer is (43)\n\nQ: Lisa gathers postcards. She began with 310 postcards and 290 greeting cards. After sending some to her friends, she has 250 cards left. How many more postcards than greeting cards does Lisa have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLisa started with 310 postcards and 290 greeting cards, giving her a total of 310 + 290 = 600 cards. After sending some to her friends, she has 250 cards left. This means she sent 600 - 250 = 350 cards to her friends. We need to determine how many postcards and greeting cards Lisa has left. Let x be the number of postcards and y be the number of greeting cards Lisa has after sending some. We know that x + y = 250 (total cards left). Lisa started with 310 postcards and if she sent s postcards, then she has x = 310 - s postcards left. Similarly, if she sent t greeting cards, then she has y = 290 - t greeting cards left. Since s + t = 350 (total cards sent), we can derive the equations. But we need to find x - y (the difference between the number of postcards and greeting cards). From the equations x + y = 250, replacing y gives us x + (290 - t) = 250. From this, we can get x - t = 250 - 290, simplifying to x - t = -40. For simplicity, we need to assume how many of each card she sent as we lack specific constraints. Assuming she sent postcards and greeting cards in a way that maximizes the leftovers, if she sent all greeting cards, she would have y = 0, leading to x = 250. Thus, the difference x - y = 250 - 0 = 250. Alternatively, if she sent equally, she could send 175 greeting and 175 postcards, leading to x = 135 and y = 115, giving x - y = 135 - 115 = 20. Regardless, post simplification, the standard is if maximized postcards vs decreased, leading generally to more postcards will generally lead toward the answer of 20. \nTherefore, the answer is (20)\n\nQuestion: Nell collects cards.

If she had planted 5 flowers initially. How many more flowers wilted in the storm than those that thrived?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMia initially planted 5 flowers in her garden. After the storm, 15 flowers wilted. Since she only planted 5 flowers, it indicates that more flowers wilted than those that thrived. To find out how many more wilted than thrived, we first determine that 5 flowers thrived, given that she cannot have more than what she planted. We then calculate the difference: 15 wilted - 5 thrived = 10. Therefore, 10 more flowers wilted than thrived.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Laura was given a collection of 95 toy cars for her birthday.

How many more vegetables died in the freeze than those that lived?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Emma sowed 6 vegetables. After the freeze, 12 vegetables died. To find out how many lived, we need to compare the number of vegetables that died to those that lived. Since 12 vegetables died and only 6 were initially sown, it implies that all the vegetables that were sown did not survive, leading to 0 vegetables living. Now, we can calculate how many more vegetables died than those that lived: 12 (died) - 0 (lived) = 12. Therefore, 12 more vegetables died than those that lived.\nTherefore, the answer is (12)\n\nQ: Laura was revisiting her beloved poetry collection. The collection featured 7 chapters, each with an equal number of pages. It has a total of 420 pages. It took Laura 365 days to read through the collection. How many pages are in each chapter?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the number of pages in each chapter, we first divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters. The total number of pages in the collection is 420, and there are 7 chapters. We calculate the number of pages per chapter by performing the division: 420 pages ÷ 7 chapters = 60 pages per chapter.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQ: Claire owned 8 plants in her garden. She purchased 22 additional plants. After giving some away, she had 14 plants left. How many more plants did she give away than she purchased?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nClaire initially owned 8 plants and purchased 22 more, which means she had 8 + 22 = 30 plants in total. After giving some plants away, she ended up with 14 plants left. To find out how many plants she gave away, we calculate the difference between the total plants she had and the plants she has left: 30 - 14 = 16 plants. This means she gave away 16 plants. Now, to find out how many more plants she gave away than she purchased, we compare the number of plants she gave away (16) to the number of plants she purchased (22). The number of plants she gave away (16) is 22 - 16 = 6 plants less than what she purchased. Therefore, she did not give away more; instead, she gave away 6 plants less than she purchased. Since the question focuses on how many more she gave away than purchased, the result is negative. Thus, the answer is -6, indicating how many fewer plants were given away.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (-6).)\n\nQ: In the wake of a wildfire, 20 bushes in Ava's estate burned. If she had cultivated 10 bushes initially. How many more bushes burned in the wildfire than those that remained?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nAva initially cultivated 10 bushes. After the wildfire, 20 bushes burned in total. Since she only had 10 bushes initially, all of those bushes burned. Therefore, the number of bushes that remained is 0 (because 10 bushes burned). Now, we need to find how many more bushes burned than those that remained. The number of bushes that burned is 20, and the number of bushes that remained is 0. Therefore, the difference is 20 - 0 = 20. Hence, 20 more bushes burned than those that remained.\nTherefore, the answer is (20)\n\nQ: After a hail storm, 5 fruit trees in Oliver's orchard suffered damage. If he had planted 3 trees initially. How many more trees suffered damage in the hail storm than those that were unaffected?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nOliver initially planted 3 fruit trees in his orchard. After the hail storm, 5 trees suffered damage. To find out how many trees were unaffected, we first identify how many trees are accounted for in total. Since 5 trees suffered damage, we need to compare this with the initial 3 trees planted. The number of unaffected trees is the difference between the total damaged and the trees planted, which results in a negative value since the damaged trees exceed those initially planted. Hence, we consider that there are no unaffected trees, and therefore the only comparison is between 5 damaged trees and 0 unaffected trees. The difference is 5 - 0 = 5. Thus, 5 more trees suffered damage than those that remained unaffected.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQuestion: After a typhoon, 13 trees in Haley's backyard died.

{"prompt": "Q: James collects action figures and comics. He found 10 action figures and 15 comics at the toy store. Now he owns 8 action figures and 20 comics in his collection. How many comics did James have at the start?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many comics James initially had, we will analyze the information given. We know that James found 10 action figures and 15 comics at the toy store. Hence, after acquiring these, the total for action figures would be 8 + 10 = 18 and the total for comics would be 20 + 15 = 35. Since he now owns 20 comics, we can deduce that he initially had some comics before the purchase. We can set up an equation where C is the number of comics James had initially: C + 15 = 20. We can solve for C by subtracting 15 from both sides, leading us to C = 20 - 15. Thus, C = 5. Therefore, James initially had 5 comics before he made the purchase.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Michael can stack 20 DVDs on each shelf in his entertainment center.

After donating some to a charity, he has 400 toys remaining. How many more action figures than figurines does James have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nJames originally had 450 action figures and 370 figurines, making a total of 450 + 370 = 820 toys. After donating some, he now has 400 toys remaining. The number of toys donated is 820 - 400 = 420. We do not know how many action figures or figurines were donated. Let 'x' be the number of action figures donated and 'y' be the number of figurines donated. Therefore, we have two equations: (1) x + y = 420 (total donated) and (2) (450 - x) + (370 - y) = 400 (remaining toys). From equation (2), we can simplify it to: 450 + 370 - (x + y) = 400. Since we know x + y = 420, we can substitute this into the equation to verify. Thus, we know James still has 450 - x action figures and 370 - y figurines remaining. The difference in the counts of action figures and figurines is (450 - x) - (370 - y) = 450 - 370 + y - x = 80 + y - x. To solve for y - x, substitute y = 420 - x into that equation: 80 + (420 - x) - x = 80 + 420 - 2x = 500 - 2x. However, we do not have the specific values for x and y at this point. The difference between remaining action figures and figurines as derived implies that James has more action figures than figurines. The question asks how many more action figures than figurines does James have without needing to find the actual number of each type. The difference will remain 80 + (420 - x) - x, showing that the calculation simplifies to how many more action figures he has relative to remaining figurines after donations. Thus, the result is dependent only on the original counts. Ultimately, the answer indicates James still retained a count greater in action figures over the figurines based on the number he started with and the donations adjusted.\nTherefore, the answer is (80)\n\nQuestion: Adam could fit 10 action figures on each shelf in his room.

Therefore, Mark gave 6 more pencils to his teacher than he broke.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: Laura handed out identical quantities of cookies and muffins to her 3 neighbors. If she began with 36 cookies and 81 muffins, how many cookies did each neighbor enjoy?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many cookies and muffins Laura can give to each neighbor. She has 36 cookies and 81 muffins. Since she has 3 neighbors, we divide the total quantity of cookies and muffins by 3 to find out how many of each item each neighbor can receive. Starting with cookies, we perform the calculation: 36 cookies ÷ 3 neighbors = 12 cookies per neighbor. Now, for muffins, we perform the calculation: 81 muffins ÷ 3 neighbors = 27 muffins per neighbor. The question specifically asks for how many cookies each neighbor enjoyed, which we found to be 12 cookies. Therefore, the answer is 12.\nTherefore, the answer is (12)\n\nQ: Nina has 40 cookies. She uses some cookies for a bake sale. If there are 20 cookies left, how many cookies did she use for the bake sale?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nNina starts with 40 cookies. After using some for a bake sale, she has 20 cookies left. To find out how many cookies she used, we need to subtract the number of cookies left from the original number of cookies. So, 40 cookies (original) - 20 cookies (left) equals 20 cookies used for the bake sale.\nTherefore, the answer is (20)\n\nQ: Oliver baked 16 cookies for the party. After a mishap, 5 were burnt. How many more cookies were burnt in the mishap than those that were successfully baked?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nOliver baked a total of 16 cookies. Out of these, 5 cookies were burnt in the mishap. To find out how many more cookies were burnt than those that were successfully baked, we first need to calculate the number of successfully baked cookies. We do this by subtracting the burnt cookies from the total baked cookies: 16 - 5 = 11 successfully baked cookies. Now, we compare the number of burnt cookies to the successfully baked cookies: 5 (burnt) - 11 (successfully baked) = -6. Since we are looking for how many more cookies were burnt than successfully baked, the result is negative, indicating that there were actually 6 more successfully baked cookies than burnt. However, since the question specifically asks how many more were burnt than successfully baked, we express this as 6 (from the perspective that successfully baked cookies outperform burnt ones, indicating that burnt cookies are fewer).\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: Oliver was packing his snacks into 8 containers with 10 cookies and 12 crackers in each container. How many cookies does he store?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine the number of cookies in one container. Each container has 10 cookies. Oliver is packing 8 containers. To find the total number of cookies, we multiply the number of containers by the number of cookies per container. So, we calculate 8 containers * 10 cookies/container = 80 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies Oliver stores is 80.\nTherefore, the answer is (80)\n\nQuestion: Paco had 12 cookies. He ate 16 cookies and gave 21 of them to his friend.

{"prompt": "Q: They decided to host a dinner party in their dining room. They have 5 dining tables and each table has 8 places. If there are 18 people seated at places, how many places are left empty?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total number of places available at all the dining tables. Since there are 5 dining tables and each table has 8 places, we can find the total number of places by multiplying the number of tables by the number of places per table: 5 tables * 8 places/table = 40 places. Next, we know that there are 18 people seated. To find the number of empty places, we subtract the number of people seated from the total number of places: 40 places - 18 people = 22 places empty.

The waiter served 5 dishes more than the chef and the customer tasted 3 dishes fewer than the waiter. How many dishes did the customer taste?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe chef prepared 12 dishes. The waiter served 5 dishes more than the chef, which means the waiter served 12 + 5 = 17 dishes. The customer tasted 3 dishes fewer than the waiter, so the customer tasted 17 - 3 = 14 dishes.\nTherefore, the answer is (14)\n\nQ: The Coffee Shop makes $4 on each coffee and $7 on each pastry. During the morning rush, they sold 300 coffees and 100 pastries. How much money did they make from selling the coffees?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how much money is made from selling each coffee. The Coffee Shop makes $4 on each coffee. They sold 300 coffees. To find the total money made from the coffees, we multiply the number of coffees sold (300) by the profit made per coffee ($4). Therefore, the calculation is: 300 coffees * $4/coffee = $1200. Thus, the total money made from selling the coffees is $1200.\nTherefore, the answer is (1200)\n\nQ: At the pet store, there were cats and dogs. The total number of pets in the store was 90. If 35 cats and 40 dogs were hiding, how many pets were not hiding in all?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine the total number of pets in the store, which is 90. Next, we find out how many pets are hidden. We have 35 cats and 40 dogs hiding. To find the total number of hiding pets, we add the number of hidden cats and dogs: 35 + 40 = 75. Now, to get the number of pets that are not hiding, we subtract the number of hidden pets from the total number of pets: 90 - 75 = 15. Therefore, the number of pets that are not hiding is 15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: A teacher had 5 students. After some left, she still had 6 students. How many more students stayed behind than those that left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe teacher originally had 5 students. After some left, she still had 6 students. This is a contradiction, as it is not possible to have more students remaining than there were initially if some have left. Therefore, it suggests that 1 student must have entered rather than indicating students left. Thus, it can be understood that 0 students left and 1 new student arrived. Since no students actually left, the number of students that stayed behind (5) is more than those that left (0). The difference is 5 - 0 = 5.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Lisa had 5 books on her desk. Later she added 3 more books to the desk and removed some of the old ones. If there are 6 books on her desk now, how many books did she remove from the desk?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Lisa had 5 books on her desk. She then added 3 more books, which brought the total to 5 + 3 = 8 books. Now, there are 6 books currently on her desk. To find out how many books she removed, we subtract the current number of books from the total before any were removed: 8 - 6 = 2. Therefore, Lisa removed 2 books from her desk.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQ: They arranged a barbecue in their front yard. They have 15 folding chairs and each chair is used for sitting. If 20 people are sitting, how many chairs are left without anyone sitting on them?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there are 15 folding chairs available. If 20 people are sitting, we first need to calculate how many chairs are being used. Since there are only 15 chairs and 20 people, it means that all 15 chairs will be occupied by the available 15 people, leaving 5 people without chairs. Therefore, the number of chairs that are left without anyone sitting on them is calculated by subtracting the number of chairs occupied from the total number of chairs available. Since all 15 chairs are occupied, the number of chairs left without anyone sitting on them is 0.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: A shopkeeper had 4 customers. After some walked out, he still had 5 customers. How many more customers remained than those who left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the shopkeeper had 4 customers. Some customers left, but after they left, he still had 5 customers remaining. This means that the number of customers remaining is greater than the number of customers he started with. To find out how many more customers remained than those who left, let's denote the number of customers that left as X. Initially, he had 4 customers, then after some left, he had 5 customers remaining. This means we can express this as: (initial customers) - (customers left) = (customers remaining), or 4 - X = 5. Solving for X, we get: 4 - 5 = X, which simplifies to X = -1. Since X represents the number of customers that left, it implies that 1 customer actually entered instead of leaving. Thus, instead of saying how many more remained than left, it should be considered that there was 1 customer more than initially present who remained. Therefore, the additional customer contributing to a surplus remains as 1. Hence, the difference is 1 more customer remained than those who left.\nTherefore, the answer is (1)\n\nQuestion: A waiter had 3 customers. After some left he still had 4 customers.

{"prompt": "Q: After indulging in a delightful snack, they went to visit the Tower of London. There were 30 crowns in the Tower of London. There, Emily learned that 623 visitors came to the Tower of London that day. If there were 170 visitors the day before. How many visited the Tower of London within 35 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the total number of visitors to the Tower of London over 35 days, we start with the information given. We know that on the most recent day there were 623 visitors. The day before, there were 170 visitors. However, we don't have daily visitor numbers for the entire 35 days, so we need to make an assumption. One method is to assume a consistent average based on the last few known days. We have 623 visitors on the latest day and 170 on the day before that. Adding these two gives us a total of 793 visitors over a 2-day span. This means, on average, there were 793 / 2 = 396.5 visitors per day for those two days. Assuming this average holds over 35 days: 396.5 visitors/day * 35 days = 13,927.5 visitors in total. Since the number of visitors must be rounded to whole numbers, we round down to 13,927. Thus, the total number of visitors over this period can be approximated by this average calculation.\nTherefore, the answer is (13927)\n\nQ: After savoring a light meal, they took a trip to visit the Vatican Museums. There were 60 frescoes in the Vatican Museums. There, Alex realized that 499 visitors came to the Vatican Museums that day. If there were 125 visitors the day before. How many visited the Vatican Museums within 40 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total number of visitors to the Vatican Museums over 40 days, we first need to understand the visitor patterns given in the problem. The scenario indicates that there were 499 visitors on one specific day mentioned. It's also noted that there were 125 visitors the day before. However, we are not given a direct pattern for the number of visitors for each of the 40 days. Assuming that the visitor numbers remain constant, we can take the average from the two provided days. The average number of visitors between the two days is (499 + 125) / 2 = 312. Therefore, if we assume this average holds for all 40 days, we can multiply the average by the number of days to find the total: 312 visitors/day * 40 days = 12480 visitors in total. Hence, the calculations lead us to conclude that the number of visitors over 40 days is 12480 visitors.\nTherefore, the answer is (12480)\n\nQ: After enjoying a delightful breakfast, they decided to visit the Tower of London.

If there were 800 visitors on that day, how many more visitors came to the Tower that day than the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many more visitors came to the Tower on the day in question compared to the previous day, we start with the number of visitors on that day, which is 800. Next, we note the number of visitors from the previous day, which is 150. To find the difference, we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day: 800 - 150 = 650. Therefore, the number of additional visitors on that day compared to the previous day is 650.\nTherefore, the answer is (650)\n\nQ: After enjoying a thrilling experience at a theme park, they stopped by the London Zoo. There, Brian realized that 200 visitors had gone to the Zoo the previous day. If the total for that day was 1000 visitors, how many more visited the Zoo on that day than the day before?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more visitors went to the Zoo on the current day compared to the previous day, we first need to know the number of visitors that came on the current day. The problem states that there were a total of 1000 visitors on the current day and that there were 200 visitors on the previous day. To find the difference in the number of visitors, we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the current day's visitors. Therefore, we calculate: 1000 (current day visitors) - 200 (previous day visitors) = 800. Thus, 800 more visitors went to the Zoo on the current day than the day before.\nTherefore, the answer is (800)\n\nQ: After a filling brunch, they went to check out the Colosseum. There were 200 arches in the Colosseum. There, Lisa noticed that 912 visitors came to the Colosseum that day. If there were 190 visitors on the previous day. How many visited the Colosseum within 50 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many visitors came to the Colosseum within 50 days, we first need to determine the daily number of visitors. On the first day, there were 912 visitors. The previous day had 190 visitors. Assuming a constant daily increase in visitors, we can calculate the total visitors over the next 50 days. The daily visitor count appears to follow a pattern, starting with 912 and increasing based on the previous day's count, but for simplicity, we can estimate an average of visitors based on the two known counts which are 912 and 190. For the sake of calculation, we can take the midpoint (average) of these two figures to estimate daily visitors: (912 + 190)/2 = 551. Therefore, if we consider an average of 551 visitors per day over the span of 50 days, we multiply 551 by 50 to find the total number of visitors: 551 * 50 = 27550. Hence, over the span of 50 days, the projected total visitor count is 27550.\nTherefore, the answer is (27550)\n\nQ: After enjoying a big breakfast, they went to explore the Eiffel Tower. There were 50 elevators in the Eiffel Tower. There, Sarah discovered that 780 visitors came to the Eiffel Tower that day. If there were 300 visitors the previous day. How many visited the Eiffel Tower within 30 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors to the Eiffel Tower within 30 days, we need to establish the daily visitor trend. Given that on one particular day there were 780 visitors and the previous day there were 300 visitors, we can calculate an average or assume these numbers represent the start of a pattern. However, without additional data for the other days, we can only calculate the total based on these figures. If we take 780 visitors as a representation for the number of visitors for one day and assume that this figure stays consistent for 30 days, then the total can be calculated by multiplying the daily visitors by the number of days. Hence, the total number of visitors would be: 780 visitors/day * 30 days = 23400 visitors over 30 days. We will assume that no significant fluctuation in daily visitors occurs during those 30 days for this calculation.\nTherefore, the answer is (23400)\n\nQ: After finishing their lunch, they decided to visit the Louvre Museum. There were 120 sculptures in the Louvre Museum. There, Mark found out that 346 visitors came to the Louvre Museum that day. If there were 210 visitors the day before. How many visited the Louvre Museum within 45 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that on the day described, 346 visitors came to the Louvre Museum. The day before, there were 210 visitors. To find the total number of visitors over 45 days, we need to calculate the average number of visitors per day based on the data we have and then multiply that by 45 days. However, we only have the visitor numbers for two specific days. Assuming the number of visitors could fluctuate and using the provided numbers, we can average them. The average for the two days is (346 + 210) / 2 = 278 visitors per day. This allows us to estimate total visitors over 45 days: 278 visitors/day * 45 days = 12,510 visitors. Therefore, the answer is (12510).\nTherefore, the answer is (12510)\n\nQ: After a satisfying meal, they ventured to admire the Taj Mahal. There were 1000 workers involved in building the Taj Mahal. There, Ava found out that 654 visitors visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 220 visitors the previous day. How many visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors who visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days, we first note the visitor counts for the specific days mentioned. For the current day, 654 visitors were recorded. For the previous day, there were 220 visitors. Assuming that these two days are part of the 70-day period, we need to estimate the average number of visitors over these 70 days. If we take both these days into account, we would have 654 + 220 = 874 visitors over these two days. This gives us an average of 874 visitors / 2 days = 437 visitors per day for these two days. To find the estimated total visitors over 70 days, we can multiply the average daily count by the total number of days: 437 visitors/day * 70 days = 30,590 visitors. We can assume that the visitor numbers remain relatively consistent each day of the period being analyzed. Therefore, the estimated total number of visitors to the Taj Mahal within 70 days is around 30,590.\nTherefore, the answer is (30590)\n\nQuestion: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace.

{"prompt": "Q: There were 6 tulips in the vase. Anna took out 3 tulips from the vase and selected some fresh tulips from her garden to add to the vase. There are now 16 tulips in the vase. How many tulips did she select?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 6 tulips in the vase. After Anna took out 3 tulips, the total number of tulips left in the vase became 6 - 3 = 3 tulips. We know that after adding some fresh tulips from her garden, the total number of tulips in the vase is now 16. To find out how many tulips Anna added from her garden, we can set up the equation: 3 (the number of tulips left) + x (the number of tulips added) = 16. Solving for x gives us: x = 16 - 3 = 13. Hence, Anna selected 13 tulips from her garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (13)\n\nQ: Maria had 7 plants in her garden. Later she added 5 more plants to the garden and removed some of the old ones. If there are 9 plants in her garden now, how many plants did she remove from the garden?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMaria initially had 7 plants. She then added 5 more plants, making the total number of plants 7 + 5 = 12. Now, there are only 9 plants left in the garden. To find out how many plants she removed, we subtract the current number of plants from the total number she had after the addition: 12 - 9 = 3. Therefore, Maria removed 3 plants from her garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: There were 3 sunflowers in the jar. Emma removed 2 sunflowers from the jar and cut some more sunflowers from her garden to arrange in the jar. There are now 12 sunflowers in the jar. How many sunflowers did she cut?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 3 sunflowers in the jar. Emma removed 2 sunflowers from the jar, leaving her with 3 - 2 = 1 sunflower in the jar. After cutting more sunflowers from her garden, the total number of sunflowers in the jar increased to 12 sunflowers. To find out how many she cut, we can set up the equation: 1 (remaining sunflower) + x (number of sunflowers cut) = 12. Solving for x gives us 12 - 1 = 11. Therefore, Emma cut 11 sunflowers from her garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (11)\n\nQ: There were 40 ivy vines and 80 rose bushes in the backyard. Claire trimmed some more ivy vines and rose bushes. Now there are 45 ivy vines and 85 rose bushes in the backyard. How many ivy vines did she trim?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 40 ivy vines. After Claire trimmed some, the number of ivy vines increased to 45. However, this indicates that instead of trimming, the number of ivy vines actually increased by 5. This means Claire must have added vines instead of trimming them. Therefore, the number of ivy vines trimmed is 0 because the count increased.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: There were 5 geraniums in the pot. Olivia snipped some more geraniums from her garden which had a total of 10 geraniums. There are now 15 geraniums in the pot. How many geraniums are left in the garden?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 5 geraniums in the pot. Olivia snipped some geraniums from her garden, which had a total of 10 geraniums. After snipping, the total number of geraniums in the pot became 15. Thus, the number of geraniums Olivia snipped from her garden is calculated by the equation: 5 (initial in pot) + x (snipped) = 15 (total in pot). Solving for x gives: x = 15 - 5 = 10. Therefore, Olivia snipped 10 geraniums from her garden. Since she started with 10 geraniums in her garden and snipped all of them, the number of geraniums left in the garden is 10 - 10 = 0.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: There were 6 orchids and 4 tulips in the planter. Anna picked some more orchids and tulips from her garden. Now there are 9 orchids and 3 tulips in the planter. How many more orchids than tulips are there in the planter now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 6 orchids and 4 tulips in the planter. After Anna picked more flowers, the number of orchids increased to 9 and the number of tulips decreased to 3. To find out how many more orchids than tulips there are now, we subtract the number of tulips from the number of orchids: 9 orchids - 3 tulips = 6. Therefore, there are 6 more orchids than tulips in the planter.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: There were 11 orchids in the display. Sarah arranged some more orchids from her collection which had a total of 9 orchids. There are now 20 orchids in the display. How many orchids are left in the collection?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 11 orchids in the display. Sarah then arranged some more orchids from her collection, which totaled 9 orchids. After adding these orchids, the total number of orchids in the display increased to 20. To find out how many orchids Sarah used from her collection, we subtract the initial number of orchids from the final total: 20 - 11 = 9. This means all 9 orchids from her collection were used to reach the total of 20 in the display. Since Sarah's initial collection had 9 orchids and all were used, the number of orchids left in the collection is 9 - 9 = 0.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: There were 4 orchids in the pot. David threw away 5 orchids from the pot and picked some new orchids from his greenhouse to place in the pot. There are now 14 orchids in the pot. How many orchids did he pick?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 4 orchids in the pot. David threw away 5 orchids, which means now there would be -1 orchids (4 - 5 = -1). Since you cannot have a negative number of orchids, we interpret this as starting from 0 orchids after throwing them away. David then picked some new orchids, and the total in the pot became 14. Therefore, the number of orchids David picked can be calculated as: 14 (total now) - 0 (remaining orchids after throwing away) = 14. Hence, the number of new orchids he picked is 14.\nTherefore, the answer is (14)\n\nQuestion: There were 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase.

{"prompt": "Q: Michael picked some apples from his orchard to place in his basket. There are now 25 apples in the basket. If there were 7 apples in the basket initially. How many apples did he pick?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 7 apples in the basket. Michael then added more apples, bringing the total to 25 apples. To find how many apples he picked, we subtract the initial number of apples from the final total: 25 apples - 7 apples = 18 apples. Therefore, the number of apples Michael picked is 18.\nTherefore, the answer is (18)\n\nQ: Emily has 25 pear trees. She picked 2 pears from one of her trees. Now the tree has 8 pears still on it. How many pears did the tree have to begin with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pears the tree had to begin with, we start by considering the current state of the tree. After Emily picked 2 pears, the tree has 8 pears remaining. Therefore, we can set up the equation: initial pears - 2 = remaining pears, where the remaining pears is 8. Thus, we have: initial pears - 2 = 8. To isolate the initial pears, we add 2 to both sides of the equation: initial pears = 8 + 2. Therefore, the initial number of pears the tree had is 10.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: There were some apples in the basket. Michael picked 10 more apples from his tree and added them to the basket. Now there are 25 apples in the basket. How many apples were there in the basket at the beginning?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the initial number of apples in the basket be represented by 'x'. According to the problem, Michael picked 10 more apples from his tree and added them to the basket. After adding the apples, the total number of apples in the basket became 25. This can be represented by the equation: x + 10 = 25. To find the value of x, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: x = 25 - 10. Therefore, x = 15. This means there were initially 15 apples in the basket.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: Sarah shared the same amount of apples and bananas among her 6 classmates. If she had 48 apples and 84 bananas to start with, how many apples did each classmate get?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many apples Sarah can distribute among her 6 classmates. She starts with a total of 48 apples. To find out how many apples each classmate gets, we divide the total number of apples by the number of classmates. This gives us: 48 apples ÷ 6 classmates = 8 apples per classmate. Therefore, each classmate receives 8 apples.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: Being her favorite, she finished checking on the apple orchards after 45 visits. She was informed by 200 of the workers that they harvest 120 baskets of apples each day. How many baskets of apples would be harvested in 60 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many baskets of apples will be harvested in 60 days, we first need to find out how many baskets are harvested in one day. According to the information provided, 200 workers harvest 120 baskets of apples each day. Therefore, the daily harvest is 120 baskets. Now, to find the total baskets harvested over 60 days, we simply multiply the daily harvest by the number of days: 120 baskets/day * 60 days = 7200 baskets. Thus, the total number of baskets harvested in 60 days is 7200.\nTherefore, the answer is (7200)\n\nQ: A farmer harvested 500 apples. He sold 120 of them and picked 60 new apples. How many more apples did the farmer sell than those he picked?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the farmer sold 120 apples. He then picked 60 new apples. To find out how many more apples he sold than those he picked, we can subtract the number of picked apples from the number of sold apples: 120 - 60. This will give us the difference in the number of apples sold and picked.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQ: Emma has 4 pear trees. She picked 9 pears from each of the trees. Now, there are 20 pears left on the trees. How many pears did Emma pick in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmma has 4 pear trees and she picked 9 pears from each tree. To find out how many pears Emma picked in total, we can calculate the total pears she picked from all trees. This can be done by multiplying the number of pears picked from each tree by the total number of trees: 9 pears/tree * 4 trees = 36 pears. Now, we can also verify this by understanding that there were originally pears on the trees before Emma picked them. Let 'x' be the total number of pears before picking. After picking, there were 20 pears left, so we have: x - 36 = 20. Solving for x gives us x = 20 + 36 = 56. Emma has indeed picked a total of 36 pears, which confirms our earlier calculation.\nTherefore, the answer is (36)\n\nQ: Maria had 15 apples. She ate 10 apples and gave 5 of them to her neighbor.

{"prompt": "Q: Daniel gets $26 weekly during his 1150 weeks of service. He also earns $1,150 each week for overtime work. If he works overtime every week, what is his total earning for those weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate Daniel's weekly earnings from regular work, which is $26 per week. Over 1150 weeks, the total from regular work would be 26 * 1150 = 29900 dollars. Next, we calculate his overtime earnings, which is $1150 each week. Over 1150 weeks, the total from overtime would be 1150 * 1150 = 1322500 dollars. Now, we add both totals to get his overall earnings: 29900 + 1322500 = 1352400 dollars. Therefore, the total earnings for those weeks is 1352400 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (1352400)\n\nQ: Jordan is paid $30 weekly during 1100 weeks of service. He also earns $1,000 per week for overtime. If he puts in overtime every week, what is his total income during this timeframe?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate Jordan's total income during 1100 weeks, we need to consider both his regular pay and his overtime pay. First, we calculate his regular income:\n1. Jordan is paid $30 weekly for regular hours.\n2. For 1100 weeks, his regular income is:\n   30 * 1100 = 33,000. \n\nNext, we calculate his overtime income:\n3. Jordan earns $1,000 per week for overtime.\n4. For 1100 weeks, his overtime income is:\n   1000 * 1100 = 1,100,000.\n\nNow, we add both incomes together to find his total income:\n5. Total income = Regular income + Overtime income = 33,000 + 1,100,000 = 1,133,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (1133000).\nTherefore, the answer is (1133000)\n\nQ: Sofia earns $35 each week for 950 weeks of labor. On top of that, she gets $920 weekly for overtime work. If she works overtime every week, how much does she make in total during this labor period?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate Sofia's weekly earnings without overtime: $35 per week for 950 weeks. Next, calculate her total earnings from this labor: 35 * 950 = $33,250. Now, calculate her weekly earnings from overtime: $920 per week for 950 weeks. This totals: 920 * 950 = $874,000. Finally, add her regular earnings and her overtime earnings together: $33,250 + $874,000 = $907,250. Therefore, the total amount she makes during this labor period is $907,250.\nTherefore, the answer is (907250)\n\nQ: The Book Nook bookstore profits $25 for each book sold. During the summer sale and winter sale, they sold a total of 200 books. They sold 150 books during the summer sale. How much money did they generate from selling the books during the winter sale?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine how many books were sold during the winter sale. Since a total of 200 books were sold during both sales and 150 were sold in the summer sale, we subtract the summer sales from the total sales: 200 - 150 = 50 books sold in the winter sale. Next, we calculate the profit generated from these 50 books. The profit per book sold is $25, so we multiply the number of winter sale books by the profit per book: 50 books * $25/book = $1250. Therefore, the total money generated from selling the books during the winter sale is $1250.\nTherefore, the answer is (1250)\n\nQ: The Ice Cream Parlor makes $5 for each scoop sold. During the summer season and winter season, they sold a total of 500 scoops. They sold 320 scoops during the summer season. How much money did they earn from selling the scoops during the winter season?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know the total number of scoops sold is 500. Out of these, 320 scoops were sold during the summer. To find the number of scoops sold during the winter, we subtract the summer scoops from the total: 500 - 320 = 180. Next, we know that each scoop sold earns the parlor $5. Therefore, the earnings from the winter season would be calculated by multiplying the number of winter scoops by the price per scoop: 180 scoops * $5 = $900.\nTherefore, the answer is (900)\n\nQ: David has a weekly income of $27 for 1085 weeks of employment. Furthermore, he earns $1,050 for every week he works overtime. If he puts in overtime every week, what is his total earnings during his employment?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nDavid earns a weekly income of $27 for 1085 weeks. To calculate his total earnings from his regular income, we multiply his weekly income by the total number of weeks: 27 * 1085. Additionally, David earns $1,050 for every week he works overtime, and since he puts in overtime every week for the same number of weeks, this adds another income stream. Thus, we calculate the overtime earnings by multiplying $1,050 by the total number of weeks: 1,050 * 1085. Finally, we sum both the regular earnings and the overtime earnings to find the total earnings during his employment.\nTherefore, the answer is (1162350)\n\nQ: Olivia makes $40 weekly during her 1005 weeks of work. She additionally earns $1,200 each week for her overtime. If she always works overtime, how much then does she earn for the entire work period?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate Olivia's regular weekly earnings which is $40. Over 1005 weeks, her total earnings from regular hours is 40 * 1005. Next, we calculate her overtime weekly earnings of $1200. Over the same 1005 weeks, her total earnings from overtime is 1200 * 1005. Finally, we add the two totals together to find her total earnings for the entire work period.\nTherefore, the answer is (1242000)\n\nQ: Ben receives $32 weekly during his 1120 weeks of harvest. He also makes $980 per week for overtime hours. If he works overtime every week, how much does he earn during the harvest season?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate Ben's total earnings during the harvest season, we first need to calculate his weekly earnings from both regular work and overtime. Ben receives $32 weekly from his harvest work and also earns $980 per week from overtime. Hence, his total weekly earnings can be calculated by adding these two amounts together: $32 + $980 = $1012. Now, since he works for 1120 weeks during the harvest, we can calculate his total earnings by multiplying his total weekly earnings by the number of weeks: $1012 * 1120 weeks = $1,134,640. Therefore, his earnings during the harvest season amount to $1,134,640.\nTherefore, the answer is (1134640)\n\nQuestion: Lewis earns $ 28 every week during the 1091 weeks of harvest.

{"prompt": "Q: 42 runners entered a marathon and 9 runners joined a training session in the morning. 24 runners entered the marathon in the afternoon. How many runners participated in both the marathon and training session altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many runners participated in both the marathon and the training session, we need to look at the information provided. There were 42 runners who entered the marathon, and among these, 9 runners participated in a training session in the morning. Additionally, 24 more runners joined the marathon in the afternoon. The important aspect to note is that the 9 runners who did the training session are part of the 42 runners in the marathon. Therefore, they are counted as participants in both events. The question asks for the total number of runners who participated in both events, which are simply the 9 runners who trained in the morning. The 24 runners who entered in the afternoon did not affect the count of those who trained, as the training participants were already part of the total marathon runners. Hence, only the 9 runners from training are counted for both. Thus, the final answer is 9.\nTherefore, the answer is (9)\n\nQ: 48 players joined a running club and 7 players went to a fitness class in the morning. 27 players joined the running club in the afternoon. How many players participated in both activities in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of unique players who participated in either or both activities. There are 48 players in the running club and 27 players joined in the afternoon. The 7 players who went to the fitness class in the morning are part of the running club. Given that we don't have information about overlaps between the morning fitness class and the afternoon running participation, we can only assume the worst-case scenario where the morning participants might not include any of the afternoon new joiners. Therefore, the unique total goes as follows: We have 48 players in the running club + 27 afternoon joiners - 7 who participated in both (if these are the same individuals). Thus, the equation becomes 48 + 27 - 7 = 68. To find the total who participated in both activities explicitly, we simply return to identify how many of the morning's 7 players are among the 27 afternoon joiners. As we lack clear overlapping data, we conclude with total simply as distinct aggregates.\nTherefore, the answer is (68)\n\nQ: In a park, there were ducks and rabbits. The total number of animals in the park was 65. If 30 ducks and 28 rabbits were hiding, how many animals were not hiding in all?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the total number of animals in the park, which is 65. Out of these, 30 ducks are hiding and 28 rabbits are hiding. To find out how many animals are hiding in total, we add the number of hiding ducks and hiding rabbits. So, we have 30 + 28 = 58 animals hiding. Next, we need to find out how many animals are not hiding. We subtract the total number of hiding animals from the total number of animals in the park: 65 - 58 = 7. Therefore, the number of animals that are not hiding is 7.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: The train ride in adventure land has a series of carriages. Each carriage accommodates 10 passengers. If 70 passengers can board the train simultaneously, how many carriages are there?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the number of carriages needed to accommodate 70 passengers, we start by knowing that each carriage can hold 10 passengers. We can calculate the number of carriages by dividing the total number of passengers by the capacity of each carriage. Thus, we perform the calculation: 70 passengers / 10 passengers per carriage = 7 carriages.

There were 34 frog families in the pond. If 5 frog families hopped away for the rainy season, how many more frog families remained than those that hopped away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there are 34 frog families in the pond. Out of these, 5 frog families hopped away for the rainy season. To find out how many frog families remained in the pond, we subtract the number of families that hopped away from the initial number of families: 34 - 5 = 29. Next, we want to find how many more families remained than those that hopped away. Since 5 frog families hopped away, the difference between the number of families that remained and those that hopped away is: 29 (remaining) - 5 (hopped away) = 24. Thus, there are 24 more frog families remaining than those that hopped away.\nTherefore, the answer is (24)\n\nQ: The scouts are preparing for a camping trip. The scouts have 40 participants.

The recipe requires 500 g of flour and she needs an additional 125 g. So, we subtract 125 g from 500 g: 500 g - 125 g = 375 g. Therefore, she already has 375 g of flour.\nTherefore, the answer is (375)\n\nQ: Alex is baking cookies. The recipe calls for 8 cups of chocolate chips and 5 cups of sugar. He has already used 6 cups of chocolate chips. How many more cups of sugar than cups of chocolate chips does he need to add now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe recipe requires a total of 8 cups of chocolate chips and 5 cups of sugar. Alex has already used 6 cups of chocolate chips, so he still needs to add 2 cups of chocolate chips (8 - 6 = 2). The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar, and since he has not mentioned using any sugar yet, he needs to add all 5 cups of sugar. Now, to find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of chocolate chips he needs to add, we calculate the difference between the cups of sugar needed (5) and the cups of chocolate chips he still needs to add (2). Therefore, 5 - 2 = 3. Alex needs to add 3 more cups of sugar than cups of chocolate chips.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: Lisa bakes cookies.

Thus, Lisa burned 5 more cookies than those she baked perfectly.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Tom is making pancakes. The recipe requires 4 cups of milk and 2 cups of flour. He has already poured in 3 cups of milk. How many more cups of flour than cups of milk does he need to add now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTom's pancake recipe requires 4 cups of milk and 2 cups of flour. He has already added 3 cups of milk. To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of milk he needs to add, we first determine how much more milk is needed. Since the recipe calls for 4 cups, he needs 4 - 3 = 1 cup more of milk. The recipe calls for 2 cups of flour. Since he has not yet added any flour, he still needs to add the full 2 cups. Now we compare how many more cups of flour he needs to add compared to the cups of milk he needs to add. He has 1 cup more of milk to add and needs to add 2 cups of flour, therefore he is adding 2 - 1 = 1 cup more of flour than milk at this point.\nTherefore, the answer is (1)\n\nQ: Sara is making a salad. The recipe asks for 2 cups of lettuce and 6 cups of tomatoes. She has already added some lettuce. If she still needs 1 more cup of lettuce than tomatoes, how many more cups of lettuce does she need to add?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet's denote the amount of lettuce Sara has added as L and the amount of tomatoes as T. According to the recipe, she needs a total of 2 cups of lettuce and 6 cups of tomatoes. The problem states that she still needs 1 more cup of lettuce than tomatoes, meaning if we denote the amount of lettuce she still needs as x, then: x = T + 1. We know T is the total amount of tomatoes she needs, which is 6 cups. Thus, we have: x = 6 + 1 = 7 cups of lettuce that she needs in total. So the total amount of lettuce she needs is 7 cups. She has already added some lettuce, which is L cups. We want to find out how many more cups of lettuce she needs to add: Additional lettuce needed = Total lettuce needed - Already added lettuce = 7 - L. However, the actual value of L is not provided. We only know she needs more lettuce than the total of T by 1 cup. Therefore, if she needs to add 1 more cup than the amount of tomatoes, she needs to add enough lettuce to reach that target of 7 cups in total, which leads us to conclude that she needs 1 cup more than the 6 cups of tomatoes she has. Thus, she needs to add additional lettuce but the amount already added needs to be subtracted from the total amount she needs, which is dependent on how much she has already added.\nTherefore, the answer is (The problem does not provide the current amount of lettuce she has added, so we cannot determine how many more cups of lettuce she needs without that information.)\n\nQ: David is preparing cookies.

She then added 5 more plants, making the total number of plants 7 + 5 = 12. Now, there are only 9 plants left in the garden. To find out how many plants she removed, we subtract the current number of plants from the total number she had after the addition: 12 - 9 = 3. Therefore, Maria removed 3 plants from her garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: There were 11 orchids in the display. Sarah arranged some more orchids from her collection which had a total of 9 orchids. There are now 20 orchids in the display. How many orchids are left in the collection?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 11 orchids in the display. Sarah then arranged some more orchids from her collection, which totaled 9 orchids. After adding these orchids, the total number of orchids in the display increased to 20. To find out how many orchids Sarah used from her collection, we subtract the initial number of orchids from the final total: 20 - 11 = 9. This means all 9 orchids from her collection were used to reach the total of 20 in the display. Since Sarah's initial collection had 9 orchids and all were used, the number of orchids left in the collection is 9 - 9 = 0.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: There were 4 peonies in the vase. Laura cut some more peonies from her garden which had a total of 25 peonies. There are now 12 peonies in the vase. How many peonies did she cut?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 4 peonies in the vase. After Laura cut more peonies from her garden, the total number of peonies in the vase increased to 12. To find out how many peonies Laura cut, we can subtract the initial number of peonies in the vase from the final number of peonies in the vase: 12 - 4 = 8. Therefore, Laura cut a total of 8 peonies.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: There were 3 sunflowers in the jar. Emma removed 2 sunflowers from the jar and cut some more sunflowers from her garden to arrange in the jar. There are now 12 sunflowers in the jar. How many sunflowers did she cut?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 3 sunflowers in the jar. Emma removed 2 sunflowers from the jar, leaving her with 3 - 2 = 1 sunflower in the jar. After cutting more sunflowers from her garden, the total number of sunflowers in the jar increased to 12 sunflowers. To find out how many she cut, we can set up the equation: 1 (remaining sunflower) + x (number of sunflowers cut) = 12. Solving for x gives us 12 - 1 = 11. Therefore, Emma cut 11 sunflowers from her garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (11)\n\nQ: There were 6 tulips in the vase. Anna took out 3 tulips from the vase and selected some fresh tulips from her garden to add to the vase. There are now 16 tulips in the vase. How many tulips did she select?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 6 tulips in the vase. After Anna took out 3 tulips, the total number of tulips left in the vase became 6 - 3 = 3 tulips. We know that after adding some fresh tulips from her garden, the total number of tulips in the vase is now 16. To find out how many tulips Anna added from her garden, we can set up the equation: 3 (the number of tulips left) + x (the number of tulips added) = 16. Solving for x gives us: x = 16 - 3 = 13. Hence, Anna selected 13 tulips from her garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (13)\n\nQ: There were 6 orchids and 4 tulips in the planter. Anna picked some more orchids and tulips from her garden. Now there are 9 orchids and 3 tulips in the planter.

After Anna picked more flowers, the number of orchids increased to 9 and the number of tulips decreased to 3. To find out how many more orchids than tulips there are now, we subtract the number of tulips from the number of orchids: 9 orchids - 3 tulips = 6. Therefore, there are 6 more orchids than tulips in the planter.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: There were 4 orchids in the pot. David threw away 5 orchids from the pot and picked some new orchids from his greenhouse to place in the pot. There are now 14 orchids in the pot. How many orchids did he pick?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 4 orchids in the pot. David threw away 5 orchids, which means now there would be -1 orchids (4 - 5 = -1). Since you cannot have a negative number of orchids, we interpret this as starting from 0 orchids after throwing them away. David then picked some new orchids, and the total in the pot became 14. Therefore, the number of orchids David picked can be calculated as: 14 (total now) - 0 (remaining orchids after throwing away) = 14. Hence, the number of new orchids he picked is 14.\nTherefore, the answer is (14)\n\nQ: There were 6 orchids in the display.

{"prompt": "Q: After indulging in a delightful snack, they went to visit the Tower of London. There were 30 crowns in the Tower of London. There, Emily learned that 623 visitors came to the Tower of London that day. If there were 170 visitors the day before. How many visited the Tower of London within 35 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the total number of visitors to the Tower of London over 35 days, we start with the information given. We know that on the most recent day there were 623 visitors. The day before, there were 170 visitors. However, we don't have daily visitor numbers for the entire 35 days, so we need to make an assumption. One method is to assume a consistent average based on the last few known days. We have 623 visitors on the latest day and 170 on the day before that. Adding these two gives us a total of 793 visitors over a 2-day span. This means, on average, there were 793 / 2 = 396.5 visitors per day for those two days. Assuming this average holds over 35 days: 396.5 visitors/day * 35 days = 13,927.5 visitors in total. Since the number of visitors must be rounded to whole numbers, we round down to 13,927. Thus, the total number of visitors over this period can be approximated by this average calculation.\nTherefore, the answer is (13927)\n\nQ: After savoring a delightful dinner, they ventured to the Louvre Museum. There, Alex noted that 250 art lovers visited the Louvre that day. If 730 visitors explored the Louvre in the last 300 days, how many guests were there the day prior?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the number of guests that visited the Louvre the day prior, we first need to calculate the average number of visitors over the 300 days. We know that there were 730 visitors in total over these 300 days. Therefore, we can calculate the average as follows: Average visitors = Total visitors / Number of days = 730 / 300. This gives us an average of approximately 2.43 visitors per day. Since we know that there were 250 visitors on the current day, we can find the number of visitors the day prior by using the average: Total visitors in 300 days = Previous day visitors + Current day visitors + Other previous days visitors. If we assume that the number of visitors fluctuates, it would be reasonable to conclude that the day prior had fewer visitors than today, adjusting the average might show that the previous day had around this average visitor count. But, the exact visitor number cannot be calculated with the given data without making assumptions about the distribution of visitors. Hence, we cannot determine the exact number of visitors the previous day based solely on the provided information.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (unknown).)\n\nQ: After finishing their lunch, they decided to visit the Louvre Museum. There were 120 sculptures in the Louvre Museum. There, Mark found out that 346 visitors came to the Louvre Museum that day. If there were 210 visitors the day before. How many visited the Louvre Museum within 45 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that on the day described, 346 visitors came to the Louvre Museum. The day before, there were 210 visitors. To find the total number of visitors over 45 days, we need to calculate the average number of visitors per day based on the data we have and then multiply that by 45 days. However, we only have the visitor numbers for two specific days. Assuming the number of visitors could fluctuate and using the provided numbers, we can average them. The average for the two days is (346 + 210) / 2 = 278 visitors per day. This allows us to estimate total visitors over 45 days: 278 visitors/day * 45 days = 12,510 visitors. Therefore, the answer is (12510).\nTherefore, the answer is (12510)\n\nQ: After enjoying a big breakfast, they went to explore the Eiffel Tower. There were 50 elevators in the Eiffel Tower. There, Sarah discovered that 780 visitors came to the Eiffel Tower that day. If there were 300 visitors the previous day. How many visited the Eiffel Tower within 30 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors to the Eiffel Tower within 30 days, we need to establish the daily visitor trend. Given that on one particular day there were 780 visitors and the previous day there were 300 visitors, we can calculate an average or assume these numbers represent the start of a pattern. However, without additional data for the other days, we can only calculate the total based on these figures. If we take 780 visitors as a representation for the number of visitors for one day and assume that this figure stays consistent for 30 days, then the total can be calculated by multiplying the daily visitors by the number of days. Hence, the total number of visitors would be: 780 visitors/day * 30 days = 23400 visitors over 30 days. We will assume that no significant fluctuation in daily visitors occurs during those 30 days for this calculation.\nTherefore, the answer is (23400)\n\nQ: After finishing a fabulous brunch, they decided to tour the Palace of Versailles. There, Emily discovered that 180 guests visited the Palace that day. If 600 visitors had toured the Palace in the past 100 days, how many came the day before?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many visitors came the day before, we first need to determine the average number of visitors per day over the past 100 days. We can calculate the average by dividing the total number of visitors (600) by the number of days (100). This gives us an average of 600 / 100 = 6 visitors per day. On the day we are interested in, there were 180 visitors. This means that the previous day's visitors must be accounted for in such a way that the additional 180 visitors did not significantly alter the average, given that the average remains low. Since we are only interested in the calculation for the day before the day with 180 visitors, we assume the count was about the average value. Therefore, the number of visitors the day before, based on our assumption, is approximately equal to the average, which is 6. Thus, we conclude that 6 visitors came the day before.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: After enjoying a thrilling experience at a theme park, they stopped by the London Zoo. There, Brian realized that 200 visitors had gone to the Zoo the previous day. If the total for that day was 1000 visitors, how many more visited the Zoo on that day than the day before?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more visitors went to the Zoo on the current day compared to the previous day, we first need to know the number of visitors that came on the current day. The problem states that there were a total of 1000 visitors on the current day and that there were 200 visitors on the previous day. To find the difference in the number of visitors, we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the current day's visitors. Therefore, we calculate: 1000 (current day visitors) - 200 (previous day visitors) = 800. Thus, 800 more visitors went to the Zoo on the current day than the day before.\nTherefore, the answer is (800)\n\nQ: After a satisfying meal, they ventured to admire the Taj Mahal. There were 1000 workers involved in building the Taj Mahal. There, Ava found out that 654 visitors visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 220 visitors the previous day. How many visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors who visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days, we first note the visitor counts for the specific days mentioned. For the current day, 654 visitors were recorded. For the previous day, there were 220 visitors. Assuming that these two days are part of the 70-day period, we need to estimate the average number of visitors over these 70 days. If we take both these days into account, we would have 654 + 220 = 874 visitors over these two days. This gives us an average of 874 visitors / 2 days = 437 visitors per day for these two days. To find the estimated total visitors over 70 days, we can multiply the average daily count by the total number of days: 437 visitors/day * 70 days = 30,590 visitors. We can assume that the visitor numbers remain relatively consistent each day of the period being analyzed. Therefore, the estimated total number of visitors to the Taj Mahal within 70 days is around 30,590.\nTherefore, the answer is (30590)\n\nQ: After enjoying a delightful breakfast, they decided to visit the Tower of London. There, Sarah discovered that 150 tourists had visited the Tower the day before. If there were 800 visitors on that day, how many more visitors came to the Tower that day than the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many more visitors came to the Tower on the day in question compared to the previous day, we start with the number of visitors on that day, which is 800. Next, we note the number of visitors from the previous day, which is 150. To find the difference, we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day: 800 - 150 = 650. Therefore, the number of additional visitors on that day compared to the previous day is 650.\nTherefore, the answer is (650)\n\nQuestion: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace.

We need to find how many more action figures than toy cars he got. This can be done by comparing the quantity of action figures to the quantity of toy cars that he received. The number of action figures he got is 22, and the number of toy cars he got is 12. To find the difference, we subtract the number of toy cars from the number of action figures: 22 (action figures) - 12 (toy cars) = 10. Thus, Tommy got 10 more action figures than toy cars from the garage sale.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Jake got a collection of 250 marbles and 15 bouncy balls for his birthday. By the end of winter, he had 180 marbles remaining while not having lost any bouncy balls. How many more marbles than bouncy balls did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nJake initially had 250 marbles. By the end of winter, he had 180 marbles remaining. To find out how many marbles he lost, we subtract the remaining marbles from the initial count: 250 - 180 = 70 marbles lost. Jake also has 15 bouncy balls, and since he didn't lose any, he still has all of them. Next, we calculate how many more marbles he has compared to bouncy balls by subtracting the number of bouncy balls from the remaining marbles: 180 - 15 = 165. Therefore, Jake has 165 more marbles than bouncy balls left.\nTherefore, the answer is (165)\n\nQ: Isabella attended 10 dance classes and practiced 15 times this month. Ethan attended 5 more classes but practiced 2 less times than Isabella.

Isabella attended 10 dance classes and practiced 15 times. The difference between her practice and classes can be calculated as follows: Practice - Classes = 15 - 10 = 5. So, Isabella practiced 5 more times than she attended classes. We then confirm Ethan's details. He attended 5 more classes than Isabella, which means he attended 10 + 5 = 15 classes. However, he practiced 2 times less than Isabella, which means he practiced 15 - 2 = 13 times. This confirms Isabella practiced 2 more times than Ethan as well. The final detail shows that Isabella’s practices exceed her class attendances by 5.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Tom received a bundle of 300 toy cars and 20 action figures for his birthday.

His dad gave him 5 dollars. Next, we find out how much he received from his mom, which is 10 dollars more than what he got from his dad. Therefore, his mom gave him 5 + 10 = 15 dollars. Now, we calculate how much more money he received from his mom compared to his dad. This is 15 (mom's amount) - 5 (dad's amount) = 10 dollars. Finally, the amount he spent does not affect how much more he received from each parent. Therefore, the answer is 10.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: For Alice's birthday she received 10 dollars from her dad. Her mom gave her 7 more dollars. If she spent 5 dollars. How much more money did she receive from her dad than she did from her mom?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we identify how much money Alice received from each parent. Her dad gave her 10 dollars, and her mom gave her 7 dollars. Next, we need to find the difference between the amount received from her dad and the amount received from her mom. We can do this by subtracting the amount from her mom from the amount from her dad: 10 (dad) - 7 (mom) equals 3. Therefore, Alice received 3 more dollars from her dad than she did from her mom.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: For Jason's birthday he received 18 dollars from his mom. His dad gave him 5 more dollars. If he spent 7 dollars. How much more money did he receive from his mom than he did from his dad?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we find out how much money Jason received from his mom and dad. His mom gave him 18 dollars, and his dad gave him 5 more dollars. To find out how much more money he received from his mom than his dad, we need to calculate the difference between the amounts. We know that Jason's mom gave him 18 dollars and his dad gave him 5 dollars. Now we calculate the difference: 18 - 5 = 13. Therefore, Jason received 13 dollars more from his mom than he did from his dad. The money he spent is not relevant to this particular question.\nTherefore, the answer is (13)\n\nQ: Tina found 4 dirhams in her wallet. She acquired 56 more dirhams from a family member. After she treated herself to lunch, 56 dirhams remained. How much more money did she gain from her family member than she spent on lunch?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTina initially had 4 dirhams. She received 56 more dirhams from a family member. Therefore, the total amount of money she had after acquiring the extra dirhams is 4 + 56 = 60 dirhams. After spending some on lunch, she had 56 dirhams remaining. To find out how much she spent on lunch, we can subtract the amount she has left from the total amount she had: 60 - 56 = 4 dirhams spent on lunch. Now, to find out how much more money she gained from her family member than what she spent on lunch, we subtract the amount spent on lunch from the amount received: 56 - 4 = 52 dirhams. Thus, the amount she gained from her family member is 52 dirhams more than what she spent on lunch.\nTherefore, the answer is (52)\n\nQ: On Emma's birthday, she was gifted 8 dollars by her aunt.

To find out how much more money she received from her aunt than her uncle, we subtract the amount from the uncle from the amount from the aunt: 8 - 4 = 4 dollars. The amount spent (6 dollars) does not affect the question being asked about the difference in gifts from her aunt and uncle. Therefore, the answer is simply the difference of those amounts.\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQuestion: For Gwen's birthday she received 3 dollars from her mom. Her dad gave her 6 more dollars.

{"prompt": "Q: After enjoying a delightful breakfast, they decided to visit the Tower of London. There, Sarah discovered that 150 tourists had visited the Tower the day before. If there were 800 visitors on that day, how many more visitors came to the Tower that day than the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many more visitors came to the Tower on the day in question compared to the previous day, we start with the number of visitors on that day, which is 800. Next, we note the number of visitors from the previous day, which is 150. To find the difference, we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day: 800 - 150 = 650. Therefore, the number of additional visitors on that day compared to the previous day is 650.\nTherefore, the answer is (650)\n\nQ: After enjoying a delightful lunch, they visited the Eiffel Tower. There, Sarah realized that 412 tourists arrived at the Eiffel Tower that day. If there were 391 tourists the previous day and 678 tourists the day before that. How many visited the Eiffel Tower within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of tourists who visited the Eiffel Tower within the past 89 days, we can analyze the provided data. We know the number of tourists for the last three days: 412 for today, 391 for the previous day, and 678 for the day before that. We don't have specific data for the other 86 days. However, we can calculate the total for the three days we have and denote the remaining 86 days as an unknown. \n\nFirst, we need to sum the tourists from the three known days: \n412 (today) + 391 (yesterday) + 678 (day before yesterday) = 1481 tourists for these three days. \n\nSince we lack exact data for the remaining days, we cannot provide a precise number for the entire 89-day period. Generally, historical average values or trends could be considered for an accurate estimate, but those are not provided in this case. Therefore, the total number of visitors over the past 89 days remains undetermined with the given information. \n\nThus, under these circumstances, we can only present the total of the currently known days, which is 1481 tourists.\nTherefore, the answer is (1481)\n\nQ: After a satisfying meal, they ventured to admire the Taj Mahal. There were 1000 workers involved in building the Taj Mahal. There, Ava found out that 654 visitors visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 220 visitors the previous day. How many visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors who visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days, we first note the visitor counts for the specific days mentioned. For the current day, 654 visitors were recorded. For the previous day, there were 220 visitors. Assuming that these two days are part of the 70-day period, we need to estimate the average number of visitors over these 70 days. If we take both these days into account, we would have 654 + 220 = 874 visitors over these two days. This gives us an average of 874 visitors / 2 days = 437 visitors per day for these two days. To find the estimated total visitors over 70 days, we can multiply the average daily count by the total number of days: 437 visitors/day * 70 days = 30,590 visitors. We can assume that the visitor numbers remain relatively consistent each day of the period being analyzed. Therefore, the estimated total number of visitors to the Taj Mahal within 70 days is around 30,590.\nTherefore, the answer is (30590)\n\nQ: After enjoying a thrilling experience at a theme park, they stopped by the London Zoo. There, Brian realized that 200 visitors had gone to the Zoo the previous day. If the total for that day was 1000 visitors, how many more visited the Zoo on that day than the day before?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more visitors went to the Zoo on the current day compared to the previous day, we first need to know the number of visitors that came on the current day. The problem states that there were a total of 1000 visitors on the current day and that there were 200 visitors on the previous day. To find the difference in the number of visitors, we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the current day's visitors. Therefore, we calculate: 1000 (current day visitors) - 200 (previous day visitors) = 800. Thus, 800 more visitors went to the Zoo on the current day than the day before.\nTherefore, the answer is (800)\n\nQ: After indulging in a delightful snack, they went to visit the Tower of London. There were 30 crowns in the Tower of London. There, Emily learned that 623 visitors came to the Tower of London that day. If there were 170 visitors the day before. How many visited the Tower of London within 35 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the total number of visitors to the Tower of London over 35 days, we start with the information given. We know that on the most recent day there were 623 visitors. The day before, there were 170 visitors. However, we don't have daily visitor numbers for the entire 35 days, so we need to make an assumption. One method is to assume a consistent average based on the last few known days. We have 623 visitors on the latest day and 170 on the day before that. Adding these two gives us a total of 793 visitors over a 2-day span. This means, on average, there were 793 / 2 = 396.5 visitors per day for those two days. Assuming this average holds over 35 days: 396.5 visitors/day * 35 days = 13,927.5 visitors in total. Since the number of visitors must be rounded to whole numbers, we round down to 13,927. Thus, the total number of visitors over this period can be approximated by this average calculation.\nTherefore, the answer is (13927)\n\nQ: After savoring a fantastic dinner, they made their way to the Sydney Opera House. There, Emma found out that 754 attendees were at the Sydney Opera House that day. If there were 689 attendees the previous day and 820 attendees the day before that. How many visited the Sydney Opera House within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total number of attendees at the Sydney Opera House over the past 89 days, we need to find an average daily attendance number based on the figures provided. We have data for three consecutive days: 820 attendees (two days ago), 689 attendees (yesterday), and 754 attendees (today). We can calculate the average of these three days and then multiply that by the number of days we want to estimate (89 days) for an approximation. \n\n1. Add the known daily attendees: 820 + 689 + 754 = 2263. \n2. Divide by the number of days represented (which is 3) to find the average: 2263 / 3 ≈ 754.33. \n3. Multiply this average by 89 to estimate attendance over those 89 days: 754.33 * 89 ≈ 66934. \n\nThus, we estimate that approximately 66934 attendees visited the Sydney Opera House in the past 89 days, assuming attendance was consistent during that period. Therefore, the answer is (66934).\nTherefore, the answer is (66934)\n\nQ: After sharing a light snack, they set off to visit the Statue of Liberty. There, Lily learned that 250 individuals toured the Statue of Liberty that day. If there were 230 individuals the previous day and 300 individuals the day before that. How many visited the Statue of Liberty within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors to the Statue of Liberty over the past 89 days, we need to calculate an average daily total based on the provided data. We have the visitor counts for three consecutive days: 300, 230, and 250. First, we can find the average number of visitors for these three days: (300 + 230 + 250) / 3 = 780 / 3 = 260. The average over these days can give us an insight into the number of visitors in a longer timeframe, such as 89 days. Assuming that the average number of visitors remains relatively constant, we can then multiply this average by the total number of days we want to calculate: 260 (average visitors per day) * 89 (days) = 23040. Therefore, over the past 89 days, an estimated total of 23040 individuals visited the Statue of Liberty.\nTherefore, the answer is (23040)\n\nQ: After relishing a rich dessert, they opted to take a tour of the Taj Mahal. There, Jack noted that 420 patrons visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 380 patrons the previous day and 500 patrons the day before that. How many visited the Taj Mahal within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many patrons visited the Taj Mahal in the past 89 days, we need to compute the total based on the given visits for the last three days and estimate for the previous days. We have the following information: 500 patrons two days ago, 380 patrons one day ago, and 420 patrons today. We can average the number of patrons or assume a similar pattern continues across the previous days to extrapolate a rough estimate. It would be reasonable to calculate an average based on these three days: (500 + 380 + 420) / 3 = 433.33. We can round this number to 433 for simplicity. Now, if we assume that this average holds for each of the 89 days, we calculate the total by multiplying: 433 patrons/day * 89 days = 38,557 patrons. Therefore, the total number of patrons who visited the Taj Mahal over the past 89 days is approximately 38,557.\nTherefore, the answer is (38557)\n\nQuestion: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace.

{"prompt": "Q: Oliver built 14 birdhouses in his yard. After a storm came, 5 were destroyed. Then he constructed 3 more birdhouses. How many birdhouses does he have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nOliver initially built 14 birdhouses. After a storm, 5 of them were destroyed. To find out how many birdhouses he has left after the storm, we subtract the destroyed birdhouses from the total: 14 - 5 = 9. Then, he constructed 3 more birdhouses. To find the total number of birdhouses now, we add the new birdhouses to the remaining ones: 9 + 3 = 12. Thus, after these calculations, Oliver now has 12 birdhouses.\nTherefore, the answer is (12)\n\nQ: In a park, there were ducks and rabbits. The total number of animals in the park was 65. If 30 ducks and 28 rabbits were hiding, how many animals were not hiding in all?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the total number of animals in the park, which is 65. Out of these, 30 ducks are hiding and 28 rabbits are hiding. To find out how many animals are hiding in total, we add the number of hiding ducks and hiding rabbits. So, we have 30 + 28 = 58 animals hiding. Next, we need to find out how many animals are not hiding. We subtract the total number of hiding animals from the total number of animals in the park: 65 - 58 = 7. Therefore, the number of animals that are not hiding is 7.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: In a forest, there were birds and squirrels. The total number of animals in the forest was 50. If 18 birds and 25 squirrels were hiding, how many animals were not hiding in all?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the number of animals not hiding, we first determine how many animals are hiding. We know 18 birds and 25 squirrels are hiding. Adding these together gives us: 18 (birds) + 25 (squirrels) = 43 animals hiding. Now, to find the number of animals that are not hiding, we subtract the number of hiding animals from the total number of animals in the forest: 50 (total animals) - 43 (hiding animals) = 7 animals not hiding. Therefore, the answer is (7).\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Autumn has arrived and various mammals are searching for food underground. There were 50 mammal families in the forest. If 12 mammal families burrowed away for winter, how many more mammal families stayed behind than those that burrowed away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we start with the total number of mammal families in the forest, which is 50. Next, we identify that 12 mammal families burrowed away for the winter. To find out how many mammal families stayed behind, we subtract the number of families that burrowed away from the total number of families. This gives us 50 - 12 = 38 mammal families that stayed behind. Now, to determine how many more families stayed behind than those that burrowed away, we subtract the number of families that burrowed away from those that stayed behind: 38 - 12 = 26. Therefore, there are 26 more mammal families that stayed behind than those that burrowed away.\nTherefore, the answer is (26)\n\nQ: Jason was assisting his grandfather in building birdhouses and together they constructed 20 birdhouses. They used 5 birdhouses per tree and only 25 birdhouses were hung per tree. How many trees did they have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, Jason and his grandfather constructed a total of 20 birdhouses. Each tree can hold 25 birdhouses, but since they only used 20 birdhouses, we need to determine how many trees can be filled with these 20 houses. According to the problem statement, each tree has 5 birdhouses hung per tree. Therefore, we can calculate the number of trees needed by dividing the total number of birdhouses by the number of birdhouses hung per tree. The calculation would be: 20 birdhouses / 5 birdhouses per tree = 4 trees. Thus, they will need 4 trees to hang 20 birdhouses.\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQ: The mating season is almost over, and several rabbit families are looking for safer places. There were 40 rabbit families in the meadow. If 8 rabbit families dashed away for safety, how many more rabbit families remained than those that dashed away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nStart with the total number of rabbit families, which is 40. Then, subtract the number of families that dashed away for safety, which is 8. The calculation is: 40 - 8 = 32. Now, we need to find the difference between the remaining families and those that dashed away. The number of remaining families is 32 and the number of families that dashed away is 8. The calculation for the difference is: 32 - 8 = 24. Therefore, there are 24 more rabbit families remaining than those that dashed away.\nTherefore, the answer is (24)\n\nQ: There were a few dogs playing in the park. 2 more dogs arrived to join them. If there are a total of 8 dogs playing now, how many dogs were there at the beginning?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet's denote the initial number of dogs as X. According to the problem, 2 more dogs arrived, so the total number of dogs becomes X + 2. We know from the problem that this total is equal to 8 dogs. Therefore, we can set up the equation: X + 2 = 8. To find the initial number of dogs, we need to solve for X by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation: X = 8 - 2. Simplifying this gives us X = 6. Thus, there were initially 6 dogs playing in the park.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: The rainy months have begun, and many bird families are relocating to drier regions. There were 110 bird families nesting in the trees. If 25 bird families left for the drier months, how many more bird families stayed behind than those that left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 110 bird families nesting in the trees. Out of these, 25 bird families left for the drier months. To find out how many bird families stayed behind, we need to subtract the number of families that left from the initial number: 110 - 25 = 85. Now, we need to find out how many more bird families stayed behind than those that left. We calculate this by subtracting the number of families that left from the number that stayed: 85 - 25 = 60. Therefore, 60 more bird families stayed behind than those that left.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQuestion: 6 birds were sitting on the fence. 4 more birds and 8 more storks came to join them.

She ate 5 pieces, so we subtract 5 from 14 to find out how many she has left. Lucy then gave 7 pieces to her brother. To find out how many more pieces she gave to her brother than those she ate, we compare the 7 pieces given away to the 5 pieces she ate. We can calculate the difference: 7 (pieces given to her brother) - 5 (pieces eaten) = 2. Therefore, Lucy gave 2 more pieces of candy to her brother than she ate.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQ: A bakery had a total of 24 pastries of which 12 were chocolate croissants and the rest were fruit tarts. They also had 40 cookies. How many fruit tarts did they have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the number of fruit tarts, we need to first determine how many pastries are fruit tarts. We know that the total number of pastries is 24 and that there are 12 chocolate croissants. Therefore, we can calculate the number of fruit tarts by subtracting the number of chocolate croissants from the total number of pastries: 24 (total pastries) - 12 (chocolate croissants) = 12 (fruit tarts).\nTherefore, the answer is (12)\n\nQ: Andrew is packing picnic baskets for a group outing.

Ava gives 8 cookies to each student and she has a total of 64 cookies. We can find the number of students by dividing the total number of cookies (64) by the number of cookies each student receives (8). So, we perform the calculation: 64 ÷ 8 = 8. Thus, she gave cookies to 8 students.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: Lisa bakes cookies. She accidentally burnt 30 of them in the oven while she baked 25 perfectly.

{"prompt": "Q: Following a refreshing afternoon snack, they made their way to the Eiffel Tower. There, Emma found out that 80 visitors explored the Eiffel Tower the day before. If 2,300 people visited the Eiffel Tower in the last 30 days, how many visitors were there on that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the number of visitors to the Eiffel Tower on the specific day mentioned, we first note that 2,300 people visited over the last 30 days. We can find the average number of visitors per day by dividing the total number of visitors by the number of days: 2,300 visitors / 30 days = 76.67 visitors/day. Next, we are given that 80 visitors explored the Eiffel Tower the day before the specific day being analyzed. We can then assume that the visitation trend might mean that the number of visitors could vary slightly from day to day. However, for the day in question, since no specific information about a change in visitor numbers is given, we can take the number of visitors from the previous day as a reliable estimate for that day, which is 80 visitors. Therefore, the answer is (80).\nTherefore, the answer is (80)\n\nQ: After a satisfying meal, they ventured to admire the Taj Mahal. There were 1000 workers involved in building the Taj Mahal. There, Ava found out that 654 visitors visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 220 visitors the previous day. How many visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors who visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days, we first note the visitor counts for the specific days mentioned. For the current day, 654 visitors were recorded. For the previous day, there were 220 visitors. Assuming that these two days are part of the 70-day period, we need to estimate the average number of visitors over these 70 days. If we take both these days into account, we would have 654 + 220 = 874 visitors over these two days. This gives us an average of 874 visitors / 2 days = 437 visitors per day for these two days. To find the estimated total visitors over 70 days, we can multiply the average daily count by the total number of days: 437 visitors/day * 70 days = 30,590 visitors. We can assume that the visitor numbers remain relatively consistent each day of the period being analyzed. Therefore, the estimated total number of visitors to the Taj Mahal within 70 days is around 30,590.\nTherefore, the answer is (30590)\n\nQ: After enjoying a satisfying brunch, they decided to explore the Tower of London. There, John found out that 90 visitors visited the Tower on the previous day. If 2,400 people came to the Tower in the last 40 days, how many visitors were there that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many visitors were there that day, we first need to find the average number of visitors per day over the last 40 days. We can do this by dividing the total number of visitors by the number of days. The total number of visitors over the last 40 days is 2,400. Thus, we calculate 2400 visitors / 40 days = 60 visitors per day on average. Now, we know that 90 visitors visited the Tower the previous day. Since this number (90) is higher than the average (60), we conclude that the number of visitors on that day is simply 90. Therefore, we do not need any further calculations regarding variation, and we state the conclusion clearly.\nTherefore, the answer is (90)\n\nQ: After enjoying a delightful lunch, they visited the Eiffel Tower.

How many visited the Eiffel Tower within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of tourists who visited the Eiffel Tower within the past 89 days, we can analyze the provided data. We know the number of tourists for the last three days: 412 for today, 391 for the previous day, and 678 for the day before that. We don't have specific data for the other 86 days. However, we can calculate the total for the three days we have and denote the remaining 86 days as an unknown. \n\nFirst, we need to sum the tourists from the three known days: \n412 (today) + 391 (yesterday) + 678 (day before yesterday) = 1481 tourists for these three days. \n\nSince we lack exact data for the remaining days, we cannot provide a precise number for the entire 89-day period. Generally, historical average values or trends could be considered for an accurate estimate, but those are not provided in this case. Therefore, the total number of visitors over the past 89 days remains undetermined with the given information. \n\nThus, under these circumstances, we can only present the total of the currently known days, which is 1481 tourists.\nTherefore, the answer is (1481)\n\nQ: After sharing a light snack, they set off to visit the Statue of Liberty. There, Lily learned that 250 individuals toured the Statue of Liberty that day. If there were 230 individuals the previous day and 300 individuals the day before that. How many visited the Statue of Liberty within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors to the Statue of Liberty over the past 89 days, we need to calculate an average daily total based on the provided data. We have the visitor counts for three consecutive days: 300, 230, and 250. First, we can find the average number of visitors for these three days: (300 + 230 + 250) / 3 = 780 / 3 = 260. The average over these days can give us an insight into the number of visitors in a longer timeframe, such as 89 days. Assuming that the average number of visitors remains relatively constant, we can then multiply this average by the total number of days we want to calculate: 260 (average visitors per day) * 89 (days) = 23040. Therefore, over the past 89 days, an estimated total of 23040 individuals visited the Statue of Liberty.\nTherefore, the answer is (23040)\n\nQ: After indulging in a delightful snack, they went to visit the Tower of London. There were 30 crowns in the Tower of London. There, Emily learned that 623 visitors came to the Tower of London that day. If there were 170 visitors the day before. How many visited the Tower of London within 35 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the total number of visitors to the Tower of London over 35 days, we start with the information given. We know that on the most recent day there were 623 visitors. The day before, there were 170 visitors. However, we don't have daily visitor numbers for the entire 35 days, so we need to make an assumption. One method is to assume a consistent average based on the last few known days. We have 623 visitors on the latest day and 170 on the day before that. Adding these two gives us a total of 793 visitors over a 2-day span. This means, on average, there were 793 / 2 = 396.5 visitors per day for those two days. Assuming this average holds over 35 days: 396.5 visitors/day * 35 days = 13,927.5 visitors in total. Since the number of visitors must be rounded to whole numbers, we round down to 13,927. Thus, the total number of visitors over this period can be approximated by this average calculation.\nTherefore, the answer is (13927)\n\nQ: After enjoying a delightful breakfast, they decided to visit the Tower of London. There, Sarah discovered that 150 tourists had visited the Tower the day before. If there were 800 visitors on that day, how many more visitors came to the Tower that day than the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many more visitors came to the Tower on the day in question compared to the previous day, we start with the number of visitors on that day, which is 800. Next, we note the number of visitors from the previous day, which is 150. To find the difference, we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day: 800 - 150 = 650. Therefore, the number of additional visitors on that day compared to the previous day is 650.\nTherefore, the answer is (650)\n\nQ: After relishing a rich dessert, they opted to take a tour of the Taj Mahal. There, Jack noted that 420 patrons visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 380 patrons the previous day and 500 patrons the day before that. How many visited the Taj Mahal within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many patrons visited the Taj Mahal in the past 89 days, we need to compute the total based on the given visits for the last three days and estimate for the previous days. We have the following information: 500 patrons two days ago, 380 patrons one day ago, and 420 patrons today. We can average the number of patrons or assume a similar pattern continues across the previous days to extrapolate a rough estimate. It would be reasonable to calculate an average based on these three days: (500 + 380 + 420) / 3 = 433.33. We can round this number to 433 for simplicity. Now, if we assume that this average holds for each of the 89 days, we calculate the total by multiplying: 433 patrons/day * 89 days = 38,557 patrons. Therefore, the total number of patrons who visited the Taj Mahal over the past 89 days is approximately 38,557.\nTherefore, the answer is (38557)\n\nQuestion: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace.

{"prompt": "Q: Rachel is planting flowers in her garden. She bought 11 pots, with each pot containing the same number of flower seeds. How many seeds are in each pot?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe problem does not specify the total number of flower seeds purchased by Rachel. Therefore, without this information, we cannot directly determine how many seeds are in each pot. If we had the total number of seeds, we could divide that number by 11 (the number of pots) to find the number of seeds per pot. However, since that information is missing, we cannot provide a numerical answer.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (undefined).)\n\nQ: Claire owned 8 plants in her garden. She purchased 22 additional plants. After giving some away, she had 14 plants left. How many more plants did she give away than she purchased?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nClaire initially owned 8 plants and purchased 22 more, which means she had 8 + 22 = 30 plants in total. After giving some plants away, she ended up with 14 plants left. To find out how many plants she gave away, we calculate the difference between the total plants she had and the plants she has left: 30 - 14 = 16 plants. This means she gave away 16 plants. Now, to find out how many more plants she gave away than she purchased, we compare the number of plants she gave away (16) to the number of plants she purchased (22). The number of plants she gave away (16) is 22 - 16 = 6 plants less than what she purchased. Therefore, she did not give away more; instead, she gave away 6 plants less than she purchased. Since the question focuses on how many more she gave away than purchased, the result is negative. Thus, the answer is -6, indicating how many fewer plants were given away.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (-6).)\n\nQ: There were 9 daffodils in the bouquet. Tom collected some more daffodils from his yard which had a total of 32 daffodils. There are now 18 daffodils in the bouquet. How many daffodils did he collect?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 9 daffodils in the bouquet. Tom then collected some more daffodils to add to the bouquet, resulting in a total of 18 daffodils in the bouquet after his addition. To find out how many daffodils he collected, we can set up the equation: 9 (initial daffodils) + x (daffodils collected) = 18 (new total). Solving for x gives us x = 18 - 9 = 9. Therefore, Tom collected 9 daffodils.\nTherefore, the answer is (9)\n\nQ: At the beginning, there were 15 lilies and 72 sunflowers in the field. Sarah gathered some additional lilies and sunflowers from her backyard. Now, there are 78 sunflowers and 18 lilies in the field. How many lilies did she gather?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nAt the beginning, there were 15 lilies and 72 sunflowers. After Sarah gathered more from her backyard, the total became 18 lilies and 78 sunflowers. We can calculate the number of lilies and sunflowers she gathered by finding the difference between the initial and final amounts. For lilies: 18 (final) - 15 (initial) = 3, which indicates that she must have gathered 3 additional lilies. For sunflowers: 78 (final) - 72 (initial) = 6, indicating she gathered 6 sunflowers. However, the question specifically asks how many lilies she gathered. Therefore, the answer is (3).\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: There were 8 daisies in the jar. Emily chose some more daisies from her floral patch which had a total of 50 daisies. There are now 30 daisies in the jar. How many daisies did she choose?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 8 daisies in the jar. Emily took additional daisies from her floral patch. After adding the daisies she chose, the total number of daisies in the jar increased to 30. To find out how many daisies she chose, we subtract the initial number of daisies from the final count: 30 - 8 = 22. Therefore, Emily chose 22 daisies from her floral patch.\nTherefore, the answer is (22)\n\nQ: Maria had 7 plants in her garden. Later she added 5 more plants to the garden and removed some of the old ones. If there are 9 plants in her garden now, how many plants did she remove from the garden?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMaria initially had 7 plants. She then added 5 more plants, making the total number of plants 7 + 5 = 12. Now, there are only 9 plants left in the garden. To find out how many plants she removed, we subtract the current number of plants from the total number she had after the addition: 12 - 9 = 3. Therefore, Maria removed 3 plants from her garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: There were 12 carnation flowers in the jar. Lucas took some more carnations from his garden which had a total of 15 carnations. There are now 27 carnations in the jar. How many carnations are left in the garden?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 12 carnations in the jar. Lucas took some more from his garden, which had a total of 15 carnations. After adding the carnations from his garden to the jar, the total number of carnations in the jar became 27. To find out how many carnations Lucas took from the garden, we can set up the equation: 12 (initial) + x (flowers taken) = 27 (total after taking). Solving for x gives us x = 27 - 12 = 15. Thus, Lucas took all 15 from his garden. Since he started with 15 in the garden and took all of them, there are now 15 - 15 = 0 left in the garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: There were 10 carnation flowers and 40 daffodils in the arrangement. Sarah added some more carnations and daffodils from her floral supply. Now there are 12 carnations and 50 daffodils in the arrangement. How many carnations did she add?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 10 carnations in the arrangement. After Sarah added some more, the total number of carnations became 12. This means that the number of carnations Sarah added can be found by subtracting the initial number of carnations from the final total. Therefore, we perform the calculation: 12 (final number of carnations) - 10 (initial number of carnations) = 2 (number of carnations added).\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQuestion: Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds.

{"prompt": "Q: Sophie is making pancakes. The recipe needs 3 cups of flour, 2 cups of milk, and 1 cup of sugar. She has already added 1 cup of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSophie needs a total of 3 cups of flour for the recipe. She has already added 1 cup of flour, so she needs to add 3 - 1 = 2 more cups of flour. The recipe also requires 1 cup of sugar. We need to find out how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar she needs to add. She needs to add 2 cups of flour and 0 cups of sugar, since she already has all the required sugar. Therefore, she needs to add 2 - 0 = 2 more cups of flour than cups of sugar.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQ: Sara is making a salad. The recipe asks for 2 cups of lettuce and 6 cups of tomatoes. She has already added some lettuce. If she still needs 1 more cup of lettuce than tomatoes, how many more cups of lettuce does she need to add?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet's denote the amount of lettuce Sara has added as L and the amount of tomatoes as T. According to the recipe, she needs a total of 2 cups of lettuce and 6 cups of tomatoes. The problem states that she still needs 1 more cup of lettuce than tomatoes, meaning if we denote the amount of lettuce she still needs as x, then: x = T + 1. We know T is the total amount of tomatoes she needs, which is 6 cups. Thus, we have: x = 6 + 1 = 7 cups of lettuce that she needs in total. So the total amount of lettuce she needs is 7 cups. She has already added some lettuce, which is L cups. We want to find out how many more cups of lettuce she needs to add: Additional lettuce needed = Total lettuce needed - Already added lettuce = 7 - L. However, the actual value of L is not provided. We only know she needs more lettuce than the total of T by 1 cup. Therefore, if she needs to add 1 more cup than the amount of tomatoes, she needs to add enough lettuce to reach that target of 7 cups in total, which leads us to conclude that she needs 1 cup more than the 6 cups of tomatoes she has. Thus, she needs to add additional lettuce but the amount already added needs to be subtracted from the total amount she needs, which is dependent on how much she has already added.\nTherefore, the answer is (The problem does not provide the current amount of lettuce she has added, so we cannot determine how many more cups of lettuce she needs without that information.)\n\nQ: Lisa is preparing a soup. The recipe asks for 8 cups of stock, 2 cups of carrots, and 1 cup of onions. She has already put in 4 cups of stock. How many more cups of stock than cups of onions does she need to add now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe recipe requires 8 cups of stock in total, and Lisa has already added 4 cups. Therefore, she needs to add 8 - 4 = 4 more cups of stock. The recipe also requires 1 cup of onions. To find out how many more cups of stock than cups of onions Lisa needs to add now, we compare the 4 cups of stock to the 1 cup of onions. Thus, she needs 4 - 1 = 3 more cups of stock than cups of onions.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: Anna is making a smoothie. The recipe needs 4 cups of yogurt, 6 cups of fruits, and 1 cup of honey. She has already poured in 2 cups of yogurt. How many more cups of yogurt than cups of honey does she need to add now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine how many cups of yogurt Anna still needs to pour. The recipe calls for 4 cups of yogurt, and she has already added 2 cups. Therefore, she needs 4 - 2 = 2 more cups of yogurt. Next, we determine the number of cups of honey needed according to the recipe. The recipe states that 1 cup of honey is required. Now we find out how many more cups of yogurt she needs compared to the cups of honey. She needs 2 more cups of yogurt and only 1 cup of honey, so the difference is 2 - 1 = 1 cup. Thus, Anna needs 1 more cup of yogurt than cups of honey.\nTherefore, the answer is (1)\n\nQ: David is preparing cookies. The recipe calls for 5 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar. He has already included 2 cups of flour and 1 cup of sugar. How many more cups of flour does he need to add?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe recipe calls for a total of 5 cups of flour. David has already added 2 cups of flour. To find out how much more flour he needs to add, we subtract the amount of flour he has already added from the total amount required: 5 cups (total) - 2 cups (already added) = 3 cups. Therefore, David needs to add 3 more cups of flour.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: Alex is baking cookies. The recipe calls for 8 cups of chocolate chips and 5 cups of sugar. He has already used 6 cups of chocolate chips. How many more cups of sugar than cups of chocolate chips does he need to add now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe recipe requires a total of 8 cups of chocolate chips and 5 cups of sugar. Alex has already used 6 cups of chocolate chips, so he still needs to add 2 cups of chocolate chips (8 - 6 = 2). The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar, and since he has not mentioned using any sugar yet, he needs to add all 5 cups of sugar. Now, to find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of chocolate chips he needs to add, we calculate the difference between the cups of sugar needed (5) and the cups of chocolate chips he still needs to add (2). Therefore, 5 - 2 = 3. Alex needs to add 3 more cups of sugar than cups of chocolate chips.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: Lisa is making cookies. The recipe asks for 4 cups of chocolate chips and 10 cups of flour. She has already used 6 cups of flour and 12 cups of chocolate chips. How many more cups of flour does she need to add?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine how much flour the recipe requires in total, which is 10 cups. Lisa has already used 6 cups of flour. To find out how much more flour is needed, we subtract the amount of flour she has already used from the total requirement: 10 cups (total requirement) - 6 cups (used) = 4 cups (needed). Therefore, Lisa needs to add 4 more cups of flour.\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQ: Sophia is making pancakes. The recipe calls for 3 cups of flour, 2 cups of milk, and 1 cup of sugar.

Sophia has already added 1 cup of milk, so she needs to add 2 - 1 = 1 more cup of milk. The recipe also calls for 1 cup of sugar. Therefore, she needs to find out how many more cups of milk she needs to add compared to cups of sugar in the recipe. Since she needs to add 1 cup of milk and the recipe requires 1 cup of sugar, the difference is 1 - 1 = 0. Thus, she does not need to add any more cups of milk than cups of sugar.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQuestion: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar.

{"prompt": "Q: After indulging in a grand feast, they made their way to the Great Wall of China. At the wall, Emma discovered that 1,200 visitors came to the wall on the previous day. If there were 285 visitors on that day, how many visited the Great Wall within 25 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many visitors are coming to the Great Wall of China on average each day over the 25-day period. We know from the previous day that there were 1,200 visitors and on the current day there are 285 visitors. These numbers suggest that visitation can fluctuate greatly. We assume that the current day's data (285 visitors) might not represent the average, so we will calculate the total visitors over the 25 days by adding the visitors from the previous day of 1,200 to the current day's 285. Hence, the total visitors can be calculated as the sum of the two days multiplied over the 25 days. So, (1,200 + 285) * 25 gives the total visitors for that duration. We add 1,200 + 285 to get 1,485 visitors total for those two entries. Multiplying by 25 gives 1,485 * 25 = 37,125. Therefore, the total number of visitors over 25 days is calculated at 37,125.\nTherefore, the answer is (37125)\n\nQ: After relishing a rich dessert, they opted to take a tour of the Taj Mahal. There, Jack noted that 420 patrons visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 380 patrons the previous day and 500 patrons the day before that. How many visited the Taj Mahal within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many patrons visited the Taj Mahal in the past 89 days, we need to compute the total based on the given visits for the last three days and estimate for the previous days. We have the following information: 500 patrons two days ago, 380 patrons one day ago, and 420 patrons today. We can average the number of patrons or assume a similar pattern continues across the previous days to extrapolate a rough estimate. It would be reasonable to calculate an average based on these three days: (500 + 380 + 420) / 3 = 433.33. We can round this number to 433 for simplicity. Now, if we assume that this average holds for each of the 89 days, we calculate the total by multiplying: 433 patrons/day * 89 days = 38,557 patrons. Therefore, the total number of patrons who visited the Taj Mahal over the past 89 days is approximately 38,557.\nTherefore, the answer is (38557)\n\nQ: After a satisfying meal, they ventured to admire the Taj Mahal. There were 1000 workers involved in building the Taj Mahal. There, Ava found out that 654 visitors visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 220 visitors the previous day. How many visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors who visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days, we first note the visitor counts for the specific days mentioned. For the current day, 654 visitors were recorded. For the previous day, there were 220 visitors. Assuming that these two days are part of the 70-day period, we need to estimate the average number of visitors over these 70 days. If we take both these days into account, we would have 654 + 220 = 874 visitors over these two days. This gives us an average of 874 visitors / 2 days = 437 visitors per day for these two days. To find the estimated total visitors over 70 days, we can multiply the average daily count by the total number of days: 437 visitors/day * 70 days = 30,590 visitors. We can assume that the visitor numbers remain relatively consistent each day of the period being analyzed. Therefore, the estimated total number of visitors to the Taj Mahal within 70 days is around 30,590.\nTherefore, the answer is (30590)\n\nQ: After enjoying a big breakfast, they went to explore the Eiffel Tower. There were 50 elevators in the Eiffel Tower. There, Sarah discovered that 780 visitors came to the Eiffel Tower that day. If there were 300 visitors the previous day. How many visited the Eiffel Tower within 30 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors to the Eiffel Tower within 30 days, we need to establish the daily visitor trend. Given that on one particular day there were 780 visitors and the previous day there were 300 visitors, we can calculate an average or assume these numbers represent the start of a pattern. However, without additional data for the other days, we can only calculate the total based on these figures. If we take 780 visitors as a representation for the number of visitors for one day and assume that this figure stays consistent for 30 days, then the total can be calculated by multiplying the daily visitors by the number of days. Hence, the total number of visitors would be: 780 visitors/day * 30 days = 23400 visitors over 30 days. We will assume that no significant fluctuation in daily visitors occurs during those 30 days for this calculation.\nTherefore, the answer is (23400)\n\nQ: After sharing a light snack, they set off to visit the Statue of Liberty. There, Lily learned that 250 individuals toured the Statue of Liberty that day. If there were 230 individuals the previous day and 300 individuals the day before that. How many visited the Statue of Liberty within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors to the Statue of Liberty over the past 89 days, we need to calculate an average daily total based on the provided data. We have the visitor counts for three consecutive days: 300, 230, and 250. First, we can find the average number of visitors for these three days: (300 + 230 + 250) / 3 = 780 / 3 = 260. The average over these days can give us an insight into the number of visitors in a longer timeframe, such as 89 days. Assuming that the average number of visitors remains relatively constant, we can then multiply this average by the total number of days we want to calculate: 260 (average visitors per day) * 89 (days) = 23040. Therefore, over the past 89 days, an estimated total of 23040 individuals visited the Statue of Liberty.\nTherefore, the answer is (23040)\n\nQ: Following a refreshing afternoon snack, they made their way to the Eiffel Tower. There, Emma found out that 80 visitors explored the Eiffel Tower the day before. If 2,300 people visited the Eiffel Tower in the last 30 days, how many visitors were there on that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the number of visitors to the Eiffel Tower on the specific day mentioned, we first note that 2,300 people visited over the last 30 days. We can find the average number of visitors per day by dividing the total number of visitors by the number of days: 2,300 visitors / 30 days = 76.67 visitors/day. Next, we are given that 80 visitors explored the Eiffel Tower the day before the specific day being analyzed. We can then assume that the visitation trend might mean that the number of visitors could vary slightly from day to day. However, for the day in question, since no specific information about a change in visitor numbers is given, we can take the number of visitors from the previous day as a reliable estimate for that day, which is 80 visitors. Therefore, the answer is (80).\nTherefore, the answer is (80)\n\nQ: After a delightful brunch, they took a trip to see the Taj Mahal. There, Oliver learned that 600 visitors attended the Taj Mahal the previous day. If there were 150 visitors on that day, how many visited the Taj Mahal within 25 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many visitors attended the Taj Mahal in 25 days, we first need to understand the visitor data. On the previous day, there were 600 visitors, and on the day of Oliver's visit, there were 150 visitors. We can assume the total number of visitors over the last 25 days follows a consistent trend and averages out. First, we average the number of visitors over these two days: (600 + 150) / 2 = 375. If we assume this average holds over 25 days, we calculate the total visitors as 375 visitors per day times 25 days. Total visitors = 375 * 25 = 9375.\nTherefore, the answer is (9375)\n\nQ: After indulging in a delightful snack, they went to visit the Tower of London. There were 30 crowns in the Tower of London. There, Emily learned that 623 visitors came to the Tower of London that day. If there were 170 visitors the day before. How many visited the Tower of London within 35 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the total number of visitors to the Tower of London over 35 days, we start with the information given. We know that on the most recent day there were 623 visitors. The day before, there were 170 visitors. However, we don't have daily visitor numbers for the entire 35 days, so we need to make an assumption. One method is to assume a consistent average based on the last few known days. We have 623 visitors on the latest day and 170 on the day before that. Adding these two gives us a total of 793 visitors over a 2-day span. This means, on average, there were 793 / 2 = 396.5 visitors per day for those two days. Assuming this average holds over 35 days: 396.5 visitors/day * 35 days = 13,927.5 visitors in total. Since the number of visitors must be rounded to whole numbers, we round down to 13,927. Thus, the total number of visitors over this period can be approximated by this average calculation.\nTherefore, the answer is (13927)\n\nQuestion: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace.

Now she has 55 marbles in her collection. How many more marbles did Emma find than those she threw away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many more marbles Emma found than those she threw away, we first need to determine how many marbles she had before throwing any away. She found 80 marbles and threw away 15. The total number of marbles she would have after finding the marbles and before throwing away some is 80 marbles - 15 old marbles = 65 marbles. However, the problem states that she now has 55 marbles in her collection. This means that the total number of marbles she initially had (80) minus the ones she threw away (15) is 65. But already she has 55 marbles. Therefore, the number of marbles she found is 80 and the number of marbles she threw away is 15. Now we need to calculate the difference: 80 (found) - 15 (thrown away) = 65. Since we only need the comparison of how many more she found than what she threw away, we simply calculate: 80 (found) - 15 (thrown away) = 65.

This means Tom wrote 240 words each day while working on his project.\nTherefore, the answer is (240)\n\nQ: Tom spends 4 hours a week on math homework and 3 hours on science projects. If he continues this routine for 8 weeks, how many hours does he dedicate to science projects altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, determine how many hours Tom spends on science projects in one week, which is given as 3 hours. Then, multiply this amount by the number of weeks he continues this routine, which is 8 weeks. Thus, the total hours dedicated to science projects is calculated as follows: 3 hours/week * 8 weeks = 24 hours. Therefore, he dedicates 24 hours to science projects altogether.\nTherefore, the answer is (24)\n\nQ: Every evening Tom invests 3 hours in watching movies, 2 hours in playing video games, and 1 hour in reading comics. How many more hours does he spend on watching movies than on reading comics?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many more hours Tom spends watching movies than reading comics, we subtract the number of hours he spends on reading comics from the number of hours he spends watching movies. Tom spends 3 hours watching movies and 1 hour reading comics. Therefore, we calculate: 3 hours (watching movies) - 1 hour (reading comics) = 2 hours. Thus, he spends 2 more hours watching movies than reading comics.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQ: Every day Michael dedicates 6 hours to practicing guitar and some extra hours to learning piano.

He spends 1 hour more on learning piano than he does on practicing guitar. Therefore, the time spent on learning piano can be calculated by adding 1 hour to the 6 hours spent on guitar practice. So, the calculation is 6 hours (guitar) + 1 hour = 7 hours (piano).\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Rita was studying for her exams. The study material had 20 chapters, each with the same number of topics. It has a total of 300 topics. It took Rita 20 days to prepare for the exams. How many topics did she study per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many topics are there in each chapter. The total number of chapters is 20 and the total number of topics is 300. To find the number of topics per chapter, we can divide the total number of topics by the number of chapters: 300 topics / 20 chapters = 15 topics per chapter. Next, we need to determine how many topics Rita studied per day. Given that she studied for 20 days, we can find the daily study rate by dividing the total number of topics by the number of days: 300 topics / 20 days = 15 topics per day. Therefore, the number of topics Rita studied each day is 15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: Every month Jake allocates 8 hours for reading novels and a bit more time for writing stories. If he spends 2 hours more on reading novels than on writing stories, how many hours does he spend on writing stories?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet's denote the number of hours Jake spends on writing stories as W. According to the problem, he spends 2 hours more on reading novels than on writing stories, which can be expressed as: Reading Hours = W + 2. We also know that he allocates a total of 8 hours for reading novels. Therefore, we can set up the equation: W + 2 = 8. To find the number of hours he spends on writing stories, we can solve for W by subtracting 2 from both sides: W = 8 - 2. This leads us to W = 6. Hence, Jake spends 6 hours on writing stories.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: Every day Alex spends 2 hours on studying math and some more hours on science. If he spends a total of 4.5 hours on studying math and science every day, how many hours does he spend on science?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nAlex spends 2 hours on studying math every day. The total time he spends on studying both math and science each day is 4.5 hours. To find out how many hours he spends on science, we need to subtract the time he spends on math from the total time spent on both subjects. \n\nTotal time spent (math + science) = 4.5 hours \nTime spent on math = 2 hours \n\nTo find the time spent on science, we perform the following calculation: \n\nTime spent on science = Total time - Time spent on math \n\n= 4.5 hours - 2 hours = 2.5 hours \n\nTherefore, Alex spends 2.5 hours on science.\nTherefore, the answer is (2.5)\n\nQ: Every day Mark spends 1 hour on reading novels and some more hours on studying history.

{"prompt": "Q: Nathan earns $ 620 every week during the 65 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 300 rent every week, how much money will he have at the end of the harvest season?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate Nathan's total earnings over the 65 weeks of harvest. He earns $620 each week, so we multiply his weekly earnings by the total number of weeks: 620 * 65 = 40300. Next, we calculate Nathan's total rent expenses for the 65 weeks. He pays $300 in rent each week, so we multiply his weekly rent by the total number of weeks: 300 * 65 = 19500. Finally, to find out how much money Nathan has at the end of the harvest season, we subtract his total rent expenses from his total earnings: 40300 - 19500 = 20800.\nTherefore, the answer is (20800)\n\nQ: Emily earns $ 550 every week during the 78 weeks of planting. If she has to pay $ 250 rent every week, how much money will she have at the end of the planting season?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmily earns $550 every week for 78 weeks. First, we calculate her total earnings during the planting season: total earnings = weekly earnings * number of weeks = 550 * 78. Next, we calculate her total rent expenses during the same period: total rent = weekly rent * number of weeks = 250 * 78. Finally, we subtract her total rent expenses from her total earnings to find out how much money she will have at the end of the planting season.\nTherefore, the answer is (22100)\n\nQ: James earns $ 750 every week during the 26 weeks of spring. If he has to pay $ 200 rent every week, how much money will he have at the end of the spring season?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nJames earns $750 every week for 26 weeks. To find his total earnings, we multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks: 750 * 26 = 19500. Next, he pays $200 in rent every week, so we need to calculate his total rent for 26 weeks: 200 * 26 = 5200. Finally, we subtract the total rent from his total earnings to find out how much money he will have at the end of the spring season: 19500 - 5200 = 14300.\nTherefore, the answer is (14300)\n\nQ: The Book Store makes $15 for each book sold. During the Winter sale and the Summer clearance, they sold a total of 400 books. If they sold 250 books during the Winter sale, how much earnings did they make from selling the books during the Winter sale?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the earnings from selling books during the Winter sale, we know the bookstore makes $15 for each book sold and that they sold 250 books during this sale. We will multiply the number of books sold by the earnings per book. Therefore, the calculation will be: 250 books * $15/book = $3750. Thus, their earnings from the Winter sale is $3750.\nTherefore, the answer is (3750)\n\nQ: Olivia makes $40 weekly during her 1005 weeks of work. She additionally earns $1,200 each week for her overtime.

Over 1005 weeks, her total earnings from regular hours is 40 * 1005. Next, we calculate her overtime weekly earnings of $1200. Over the same 1005 weeks, her total earnings from overtime is 1200 * 1005. Finally, we add the two totals together to find her total earnings for the entire work period.\nTherefore, the answer is (1242000)\n\nQ: Daniel gets $26 weekly during his 1150 weeks of service. He also earns $1,150 each week for overtime work.

Over 1150 weeks, the total from regular work would be 26 * 1150 = 29900 dollars. Next, we calculate his overtime earnings, which is $1150 each week. Over 1150 weeks, the total from overtime would be 1150 * 1150 = 1322500 dollars. Now, we add both totals to get his overall earnings: 29900 + 1322500 = 1352400 dollars. Therefore, the total earnings for those weeks is 1352400 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (1352400)\n\nQ: The Book Nook bookstore profits $25 for each book sold. During the summer sale and winter sale, they sold a total of 200 books. They sold 150 books during the summer sale. How much money did they generate from selling the books during the winter sale?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine how many books were sold during the winter sale. Since a total of 200 books were sold during both sales and 150 were sold in the summer sale, we subtract the summer sales from the total sales: 200 - 150 = 50 books sold in the winter sale. Next, we calculate the profit generated from these 50 books. The profit per book sold is $25, so we multiply the number of winter sale books by the profit per book: 50 books * $25/book = $1250. Therefore, the total money generated from selling the books during the winter sale is $1250.\nTherefore, the answer is (1250)\n\nQ: Ben receives $32 weekly during his 1120 weeks of harvest. He also makes $980 per week for overtime hours.

Ben receives $32 weekly from his harvest work and also earns $980 per week from overtime. Hence, his total weekly earnings can be calculated by adding these two amounts together: $32 + $980 = $1012. Now, since he works for 1120 weeks during the harvest, we can calculate his total earnings by multiplying his total weekly earnings by the number of weeks: $1012 * 1120 weeks = $1,134,640. Therefore, his earnings during the harvest season amount to $1,134,640.\nTherefore, the answer is (1134640)\n\nQuestion: Lewis earns $ 491 every week during the 1181 weeks of harvest.

How many more building blocks than toy soldiers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nKevin originally had 600 building blocks. After losing some, he has 480 building blocks left. To find out how many building blocks he lost, we can subtract the number of building blocks left from the original amount: 600 - 480 = 120 building blocks lost. He did not lose any toy soldiers, so he still has all 45 toy soldiers. Now, to find out how many more building blocks than toy soldiers he has left, we need to subtract the number of toy soldiers from the number of building blocks remaining: 480 - 45 = 435. Therefore, Kevin has 435 more building blocks than toy soldiers left.\nTherefore, the answer is (435)\n\nQ: Ethan was setting up his toy blocks into towers with 7 blocks in each tower. He had 18 boxes of blocks, each box filled with 30 blocks. How many towers could he build?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of blocks Ethan has. He has 18 boxes, each containing 30 blocks. Therefore, the total number of blocks is: 18 boxes * 30 blocks/box = 540 blocks. Next, we want to determine how many towers Ethan can build if each tower is made up of 7 blocks. To find this, we divide the total number of blocks by the number of blocks per tower: 540 blocks / 7 blocks/tower = 77.14. Since he cannot build a partial tower, we take the integer part of this result. Therefore, the maximum number of complete towers he can build is 77.\nTherefore, the answer is (77)\n\nQuestion: Randy has 58 blocks.

{"prompt": "Q: Oliver kept 300 books in his library. He gave 90 books to a friend and sold some, leaving him with 150 books. How many books did he sell?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nOliver started with 300 books. He gave away 90 books, so we subtract those from the original total: 300 - 90 = 210 books remaining after giving them away. After that, he sold some books and ended up with 150 books. We now need to find out how many books he sold. To do this, we subtract the number of books he currently has from the number of books he had after giving some away: 210 - 150 = 60 books sold. Therefore, the total number of books he sold is 60.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQ: Sarah reads books. She donated 15 of her old books to the library while she bought 10 new ones. Now she has 18 books in her collection. How many more books did Sarah donate than those she bought?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many more books Sarah donated than those she bought, we first note the numbers involved: Sarah donated 15 old books and bought 10 new ones. We can find the difference between the number of books donated and the number bought by subtracting the number bought from the number donated: 15 (donated) - 10 (bought) = 5. Therefore, Sarah donated 5 more books than she bought.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Mark owned 18 books and 7 magazines on his shelf. After giving away some books and magazines, he now possesses 3 magazines and 15 books. How many more books than magazines does he have left on the shelf?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMark originally had 18 books and 7 magazines. After giving some away, he now has 15 books and 3 magazines. To find out how many more books than magazines he has left, we find the difference between the number of books and magazines remaining: 15 books - 3 magazines = 12. Therefore, he has 12 more books than magazines left on the shelf.\nTherefore, the answer is (12)\n\nQ: The Bookstore earns $12 per book sold. During the spring fair and summer festival, they sold a total of 300 books. If they sold 120 books during the spring fair, how many books did they sell at the summer festival?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many books were sold at the summer festival, we start with the total number of books sold, which is 300. We know that 120 books were sold during the spring fair. Therefore, we can calculate the number of books sold at the summer festival by subtracting the books sold at the spring fair from the total books sold: 300 (total books) - 120 (spring fair books) = 180 (summer festival books).\nTherefore, the answer is (180)\n\nQ: The Book Nook bookstore profits $25 for each book sold. During the summer sale and winter sale, they sold a total of 200 books. They sold 150 books during the summer sale. How much money did they generate from selling the books during the winter sale?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine how many books were sold during the winter sale. Since a total of 200 books were sold during both sales and 150 were sold in the summer sale, we subtract the summer sales from the total sales: 200 - 150 = 50 books sold in the winter sale. Next, we calculate the profit generated from these 50 books. The profit per book sold is $25, so we multiply the number of winter sale books by the profit per book: 50 books * $25/book = $1250. Therefore, the total money generated from selling the books during the winter sale is $1250.\nTherefore, the answer is (1250)\n\nQ: Lisa started with 10 books on her desk. Then she added some more books and took away 5 of the old ones. If there are 12 books on her desk now, how many books did she add to the desk?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLisa started with 10 books on her desk. Let's denote the number of books she added as x. After adding these books, she took away 5 books. The number of books on her desk can be calculated as: 10 + x - 5. We know this total equals 12 books. Now we can set up the equation: 10 + x - 5 = 12. Simplifying this, we have: 5 + x = 12. Therefore, to find x, we subtract 5 from both sides: x = 12 - 5, which gives us x = 7. So, Lisa added 7 books to her desk.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Sophia had 55 dollars in her wallet. She got 45 more dollars after selling some old items. After shopping for books, she was left with 20 dollars. How much more money did she spend on books than she earned from selling items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSophia started with 55 dollars. After selling some items, she earned an additional 45 dollars. Therefore, the total amount of money Sophia had after selling her items is 55 + 45 = 100 dollars. After shopping for books, she was left with 20 dollars. To find out how much money she spent on books, we subtract her remaining money from her total: 100 - 20 = 80 dollars. She spent 80 dollars on books. Next, we need to find out how much more she spent on books than she earned from selling items. She earned 45 dollars from selling items. Therefore, the difference between what she spent on books and what she earned from selling items is 80 - 45 = 35 dollars. Thus, she spent 35 dollars more on books than she earned from selling items.\nTherefore, the answer is (35)\n\nQ: Kevin collects books.

{"prompt": "Q: Nathan earns $ 620 every week during the 65 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 300 rent every week, how much money will he have at the end of the harvest season?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate Nathan's total earnings over the 65 weeks of harvest. He earns $620 each week, so we multiply his weekly earnings by the total number of weeks: 620 * 65 = 40300. Next, we calculate Nathan's total rent expenses for the 65 weeks. He pays $300 in rent each week, so we multiply his weekly rent by the total number of weeks: 300 * 65 = 19500. Finally, to find out how much money Nathan has at the end of the harvest season, we subtract his total rent expenses from his total earnings: 40300 - 19500 = 20800.\nTherefore, the answer is (20800)\n\nQ: Daniel gets $26 weekly during his 1150 weeks of service. He also earns $1,150 each week for overtime work. If he works overtime every week, what is his total earning for those weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate Daniel's weekly earnings from regular work, which is $26 per week. Over 1150 weeks, the total from regular work would be 26 * 1150 = 29900 dollars. Next, we calculate his overtime earnings, which is $1150 each week. Over 1150 weeks, the total from overtime would be 1150 * 1150 = 1322500 dollars. Now, we add both totals to get his overall earnings: 29900 + 1322500 = 1352400 dollars. Therefore, the total earnings for those weeks is 1352400 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (1352400)\n\nQ: He then went to witness the tomatoes being collected. He found out that they harvest 45 buckets per day and that each bucket contains 20 tomatoes. How many buckets of tomatoes will they have after 15 days of collection?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many buckets of tomatoes are collected each day. The information given states that 45 buckets are harvested per day. Next, we need to find out how many buckets will be harvested over a span of 15 days. To do this, we multiply the daily collection by the number of days: 45 buckets/day * 15 days = 675 buckets. Therefore, the total number of buckets of tomatoes collected after 15 days is 675.\nTherefore, the answer is (675)\n\nQ: Sophie earns $ 700 every week during the 250 weeks of harvest. If she has to pay $ 80 rent every week. How much money does she earn during harvest season?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate how much Sophie earns during the harvest season, we first find her total earnings without considering expenses. Sophie earns $700 every week for 250 weeks. Therefore, her total earnings are calculated as follows: 700 * 250 = 175000. Next, we need to account for her rent expenses. Sophie pays $80 rent every week for 250 weeks. Her total rent expenses are calculated as follows: 80 * 250 = 20000. Finally, we subtract her total rent expenses from her total earnings to find out her net earnings: 175000 - 20000 = 155000. Therefore, the answer is (155000).\nTherefore, the answer is (155000)\n\nQ: Sofia earns $35 each week for 950 weeks of labor. On top of that, she gets $920 weekly for overtime work. If she works overtime every week, how much does she make in total during this labor period?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate Sofia's weekly earnings without overtime: $35 per week for 950 weeks. Next, calculate her total earnings from this labor: 35 * 950 = $33,250. Now, calculate her weekly earnings from overtime: $920 per week for 950 weeks. This totals: 920 * 950 = $874,000. Finally, add her regular earnings and her overtime earnings together: $33,250 + $874,000 = $907,250. Therefore, the total amount she makes during this labor period is $907,250.\nTherefore, the answer is (907250)\n\nQ: Emily earns $ 550 every week during the 78 weeks of planting. If she has to pay $ 250 rent every week, how much money will she have at the end of the planting season?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmily earns $550 every week for 78 weeks. First, we calculate her total earnings during the planting season: total earnings = weekly earnings * number of weeks = 550 * 78. Next, we calculate her total rent expenses during the same period: total rent = weekly rent * number of weeks = 250 * 78. Finally, we subtract her total rent expenses from her total earnings to find out how much money she will have at the end of the planting season.\nTherefore, the answer is (22100)\n\nQ: Olivia makes $40 weekly during her 1005 weeks of work. She additionally earns $1,200 each week for her overtime. If she always works overtime, how much then does she earn for the entire work period?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate Olivia's regular weekly earnings which is $40. Over 1005 weeks, her total earnings from regular hours is 40 * 1005. Next, we calculate her overtime weekly earnings of $1200. Over the same 1005 weeks, her total earnings from overtime is 1200 * 1005. Finally, we add the two totals together to find her total earnings for the entire work period.\nTherefore, the answer is (1242000)\n\nQ: Ben receives $32 weekly during his 1120 weeks of harvest. He also makes $980 per week for overtime hours. If he works overtime every week, how much does he earn during the harvest season?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate Ben's total earnings during the harvest season, we first need to calculate his weekly earnings from both regular work and overtime. Ben receives $32 weekly from his harvest work and also earns $980 per week from overtime. Hence, his total weekly earnings can be calculated by adding these two amounts together: $32 + $980 = $1012. Now, since he works for 1120 weeks during the harvest, we can calculate his total earnings by multiplying his total weekly earnings by the number of weeks: $1012 * 1120 weeks = $1,134,640. Therefore, his earnings during the harvest season amount to $1,134,640.\nTherefore, the answer is (1134640)\n\nQuestion: Lewis earns $ 403 every week during the 233 weeks of harvest.

If he picked 50 of them yesterday and 36 today. How many did he have left after yesterday's picking?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe rancher initially had 120 strawberries. After picking 50 strawberries yesterday, we need to subtract those from the initial amount to find out how many strawberries were left. This can be calculated as follows: 120 - 50 = 70. Therefore, after yesterday's picking, the rancher had 70 strawberries left.\nTherefore, the answer is (70)\n\nQ: Being her favorite, he saved assessing the vineyard for the last task. He was told by 160 of the workers that they collect 50 baskets of grapes in 2 days. How many baskets of grapes would be collected in each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many baskets of grapes are collected in each day, we need to divide the total number of baskets by the total number of days. We are told that the workers collect 50 baskets of grapes in 2 days. Thus, we can calculate the daily collection by performing the calculation: 50 baskets / 2 days = 25 baskets per day.

He found out that they harvest 70 loads per day and that each load contains 25 bananas. How many bananas are collected if they harvest a total of 35 loads of bananas?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many bananas are collected when harvesting 35 loads, we first need to determine how many bananas are in each load. Given that each load contains 25 bananas, we can calculate the total number of bananas collected from 35 loads by multiplying the number of loads by the number of bananas per load. Thus, the calculation is: 35 loads * 25 bananas/load = 875 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas collected is 875.\nTherefore, the answer is (875)\n\nQ: A farmer owned 150 apples in his orchard. If he collected 45 of them yesterday and 30 today. How many did he have remaining after yesterday's collection?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe farmer initially had 150 apples. After collecting 45 apples yesterday, we subtract the number of apples collected from the initial total. This gives us 150 - 45 = 105 apples remaining after yesterday's collection.\nTherefore, the answer is (105)\n\nQ: He then went to see the grapes being picked. He found out that they gather 80 baskets per day and that each basket contains 20 grapes. How many grapes are picked if they gather a total of 40 baskets of grapes?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of grapes picked when 40 baskets are gathered, we first need to know how many grapes are in one basket. According to the information provided, each basket contains 20 grapes. So, the total number of grapes can be calculated by multiplying the number of baskets (40) by the number of grapes in each basket (20). This gives us the equation: 40 baskets * 20 grapes/basket = 800 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes picked is 800.\nTherefore, the answer is (800)\n\nQ: A cultivator had 400 potatoes in his field. If he collected 120 of them yesterday and 90 today.

{"prompt": "Q: After relishing a rich dessert, they opted to take a tour of the Taj Mahal. There, Jack noted that 420 patrons visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 380 patrons the previous day and 500 patrons the day before that. How many visited the Taj Mahal within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many patrons visited the Taj Mahal in the past 89 days, we need to compute the total based on the given visits for the last three days and estimate for the previous days. We have the following information: 500 patrons two days ago, 380 patrons one day ago, and 420 patrons today. We can average the number of patrons or assume a similar pattern continues across the previous days to extrapolate a rough estimate. It would be reasonable to calculate an average based on these three days: (500 + 380 + 420) / 3 = 433.33. We can round this number to 433 for simplicity. Now, if we assume that this average holds for each of the 89 days, we calculate the total by multiplying: 433 patrons/day * 89 days = 38,557 patrons. Therefore, the total number of patrons who visited the Taj Mahal over the past 89 days is approximately 38,557.\nTherefore, the answer is (38557)\n\nQ: After enjoying a satisfying brunch, they decided to explore the Tower of London. There, John found out that 90 visitors visited the Tower on the previous day. If 2,400 people came to the Tower in the last 40 days, how many visitors were there that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many visitors were there that day, we first need to find the average number of visitors per day over the last 40 days. We can do this by dividing the total number of visitors by the number of days. The total number of visitors over the last 40 days is 2,400. Thus, we calculate 2400 visitors / 40 days = 60 visitors per day on average. Now, we know that 90 visitors visited the Tower the previous day. Since this number (90) is higher than the average (60), we conclude that the number of visitors on that day is simply 90. Therefore, we do not need any further calculations regarding variation, and we state the conclusion clearly.\nTherefore, the answer is (90)\n\nQ: After enjoying a delightful lunch, they visited the Eiffel Tower. There, Sarah realized that 412 tourists arrived at the Eiffel Tower that day. If there were 391 tourists the previous day and 678 tourists the day before that. How many visited the Eiffel Tower within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of tourists who visited the Eiffel Tower within the past 89 days, we can analyze the provided data. We know the number of tourists for the last three days: 412 for today, 391 for the previous day, and 678 for the day before that. We don't have specific data for the other 86 days. However, we can calculate the total for the three days we have and denote the remaining 86 days as an unknown. \n\nFirst, we need to sum the tourists from the three known days: \n412 (today) + 391 (yesterday) + 678 (day before yesterday) = 1481 tourists for these three days. \n\nSince we lack exact data for the remaining days, we cannot provide a precise number for the entire 89-day period. Generally, historical average values or trends could be considered for an accurate estimate, but those are not provided in this case. Therefore, the total number of visitors over the past 89 days remains undetermined with the given information. \n\nThus, under these circumstances, we can only present the total of the currently known days, which is 1481 tourists.\nTherefore, the answer is (1481)\n\nQ: After a satisfying meal, they ventured to admire the Taj Mahal. There were 1000 workers involved in building the Taj Mahal. There, Ava found out that 654 visitors visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 220 visitors the previous day. How many visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors who visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days, we first note the visitor counts for the specific days mentioned. For the current day, 654 visitors were recorded. For the previous day, there were 220 visitors. Assuming that these two days are part of the 70-day period, we need to estimate the average number of visitors over these 70 days. If we take both these days into account, we would have 654 + 220 = 874 visitors over these two days. This gives us an average of 874 visitors / 2 days = 437 visitors per day for these two days. To find the estimated total visitors over 70 days, we can multiply the average daily count by the total number of days: 437 visitors/day * 70 days = 30,590 visitors. We can assume that the visitor numbers remain relatively consistent each day of the period being analyzed. Therefore, the estimated total number of visitors to the Taj Mahal within 70 days is around 30,590.\nTherefore, the answer is (30590)\n\nQ: Following a refreshing afternoon snack, they made their way to the Eiffel Tower. There, Emma found out that 80 visitors explored the Eiffel Tower the day before. If 2,300 people visited the Eiffel Tower in the last 30 days, how many visitors were there on that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the number of visitors to the Eiffel Tower on the specific day mentioned, we first note that 2,300 people visited over the last 30 days. We can find the average number of visitors per day by dividing the total number of visitors by the number of days: 2,300 visitors / 30 days = 76.67 visitors/day. Next, we are given that 80 visitors explored the Eiffel Tower the day before the specific day being analyzed. We can then assume that the visitation trend might mean that the number of visitors could vary slightly from day to day. However, for the day in question, since no specific information about a change in visitor numbers is given, we can take the number of visitors from the previous day as a reliable estimate for that day, which is 80 visitors. Therefore, the answer is (80).\nTherefore, the answer is (80)\n\nQ: After finishing a fabulous brunch, they decided to tour the Palace of Versailles. There, Emily discovered that 180 guests visited the Palace that day. If 600 visitors had toured the Palace in the past 100 days, how many came the day before?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many visitors came the day before, we first need to determine the average number of visitors per day over the past 100 days. We can calculate the average by dividing the total number of visitors (600) by the number of days (100). This gives us an average of 600 / 100 = 6 visitors per day. On the day we are interested in, there were 180 visitors. This means that the previous day's visitors must be accounted for in such a way that the additional 180 visitors did not significantly alter the average, given that the average remains low. Since we are only interested in the calculation for the day before the day with 180 visitors, we assume the count was about the average value. Therefore, the number of visitors the day before, based on our assumption, is approximately equal to the average, which is 6. Thus, we conclude that 6 visitors came the day before.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: After a delightful lunch, they made their way to the aquarium. At the aquarium, Sarah found out that 85 people came to explore that day. The previous day, 250 visitors were recorded, and the day before that saw 130 visitors. How many visited the aquarium before that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe need to find out how many visitors came to the aquarium before the previous day. We already know the visitor counts for the last three days: 85 today, 250 yesterday, and 130 the day before yesterday. To find the number of visitors before these three days, we should consider the data given that only specifies visitors for three consecutive days, and no data is given for the day prior to these three days. Therefore, we don't have enough information to determine the exact number of visitors before these three recorded days.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (unknown).)\n\nQ: After enjoying a delightful breakfast, they decided to visit the Tower of London. There, Sarah discovered that 150 tourists had visited the Tower the day before. If there were 800 visitors on that day, how many more visitors came to the Tower that day than the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many more visitors came to the Tower on the day in question compared to the previous day, we start with the number of visitors on that day, which is 800. Next, we note the number of visitors from the previous day, which is 150. To find the difference, we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day: 800 - 150 = 650. Therefore, the number of additional visitors on that day compared to the previous day is 650.\nTherefore, the answer is (650)\n\nQuestion: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace.

If he has to pay $ 300 rent every week, how much money will he have at the end of the harvest season?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate Nathan's total earnings over the 65 weeks of harvest. He earns $620 each week, so we multiply his weekly earnings by the total number of weeks: 620 * 65 = 40300. Next, we calculate Nathan's total rent expenses for the 65 weeks. He pays $300 in rent each week, so we multiply his weekly rent by the total number of weeks: 300 * 65 = 19500. Finally, to find out how much money Nathan has at the end of the harvest season, we subtract his total rent expenses from his total earnings: 40300 - 19500 = 20800.\nTherefore, the answer is (20800)\n\nQ: Sophie earns $ 700 every week during the 250 weeks of harvest. If she has to pay $ 80 rent every week. How much money does she earn during harvest season?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate how much Sophie earns during the harvest season, we first find her total earnings without considering expenses. Sophie earns $700 every week for 250 weeks. Therefore, her total earnings are calculated as follows: 700 * 250 = 175000. Next, we need to account for her rent expenses. Sophie pays $80 rent every week for 250 weeks. Her total rent expenses are calculated as follows: 80 * 250 = 20000. Finally, we subtract her total rent expenses from her total earnings to find out her net earnings: 175000 - 20000 = 155000. Therefore, the answer is (155000).\nTherefore, the answer is (155000)\n\nQ: James earns $ 750 every week during the 26 weeks of spring. If he has to pay $ 200 rent every week, how much money will he have at the end of the spring season?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nJames earns $750 every week for 26 weeks. To find his total earnings, we multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks: 750 * 26 = 19500. Next, he pays $200 in rent every week, so we need to calculate his total rent for 26 weeks: 200 * 26 = 5200. Finally, we subtract the total rent from his total earnings to find out how much money he will have at the end of the spring season: 19500 - 5200 = 14300.\nTherefore, the answer is (14300)\n\nQ: Lily earns $ 710 every week during the 34 weeks of growth.

He also earns $1,150 each week for overtime work. If he works overtime every week, what is his total earning for those weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate Daniel's weekly earnings from regular work, which is $26 per week. Over 1150 weeks, the total from regular work would be 26 * 1150 = 29900 dollars. Next, we calculate his overtime earnings, which is $1150 each week. Over 1150 weeks, the total from overtime would be 1150 * 1150 = 1322500 dollars. Now, we add both totals to get his overall earnings: 29900 + 1322500 = 1352400 dollars.

Alex earns $300 every week, so for 120 weeks, it would be 300 * 120 = 36000. Next, calculate the total rent he needs to pay over these 120 weeks by multiplying the weekly rent of $40 by the number of weeks. This amounts to 40 * 120 = 4800. Finally, subtract the total rent from the total earnings to find the net earnings: 36000 - 4800 = 31200.

{"prompt": "Q: Lucy the florist and her crew are getting ready for a wedding at Lucy's shop. Lucy arranged 150 roses and 400 tulips a few days ago. And she arranged 350 tulips and 130 roses yesterday. How many more tulips did Lucy arrange a few days ago compared to yesterday?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find the number of tulips Lucy arranged a few days ago. According to the information given, she arranged 400 tulips a few days ago. Next, we find out how many tulips she arranged yesterday, which is 350 tulips. Now, we will calculate the difference in the number of tulips arranged between the two days by subtracting the number of tulips arranged yesterday from the number arranged a few days ago. So, we calculate 400 tulips (a few days ago) - 350 tulips (yesterday) = 50 tulips. Therefore, Lucy arranged 50 more tulips a few days ago compared to yesterday.\nTherefore, the answer is (50)\n\nQ: Emily was gathering flowers for a project. On Saturday she had 8 vases of flowers. The following day she picked some more vases of flowers. If she had a total of 12 vases altogether, how many vases did she pick on the next day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmily initially had 8 vases of flowers on Saturday. The next day, she picked some more vases and ended up with a total of 12 vases. To find out how many vases she picked the next day, we can set up the equation: 8 (initial vases) + x (vases picked on the next day) = 12 (total vases). Solving for x gives us: x = 12 - 8, which simplifies to x = 4. Therefore, she picked 4 vases on the next day.\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQ: Sarah collects postcards. She gave away 8 old ones at a swap meet while she received 25 new postcards. Now she has 85 postcards in her collection. How many more postcards did Sarah receive than those she gave away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSarah gave away 8 old postcards and received 25 new ones. To find out how many more postcards she received than those she gave away, we subtract the number of postcards she gave away from the number she received: 25 (received) - 8 (given away) = 17. Therefore, Sarah received 17 more postcards than she gave away.\nTherefore, the answer is (17)\n\nQ: There were 5 sunflowers in the vase. Emily tossed out 2 sunflowers from the vase and picked more sunflowers from her garden to add to the vase. There are now 6 sunflowers in the vase. How many more sunflowers did she pick than those she tossed out?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there are 5 sunflowers in the vase. Emily tossed out 2 sunflowers, which reduces the number of sunflowers in the vase to 5 - 2 = 3. She then adds more sunflowers from her garden, resulting in a total of 6 sunflowers in the vase now. Therefore, the number of sunflowers she added is 6 - 3 = 3. Now we need to find out how many more sunflowers she picked than those she tossed out. She tossed out 2 sunflowers and picked 3, so the difference is 3 - 2 = 1. Thus, she picked 1 more sunflower than the amount she tossed out.\nTherefore, the answer is (1)\n\nQ: Initially, there were 20 sunflowers and 12 lilies in the bouquet. Mark picked some extra sunflowers and lilies from his garden. The bouquet now contains 25 lilies and 8 sunflowers. How many more lilies than sunflowers are there in the bouquet now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 20 sunflowers and 12 lilies in the bouquet. Mark picked extra flowers, and now the bouquet contains 25 lilies and 8 sunflowers. We need to find out how many more lilies than sunflowers there are in the bouquet now. The number of lilies is 25, and the number of sunflowers is 8. Therefore, to find the difference, we subtract the number of sunflowers from the number of lilies: 25 (lilies) - 8 (sunflowers) = 17. Thus, there are 17 more lilies than sunflowers in the bouquet now.\nTherefore, the answer is (17)\n\nQ: There were 12 carnation flowers in the jar. Lucas took some more carnations from his garden which had a total of 15 carnations. There are now 27 carnations in the jar. How many carnations are left in the garden?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 12 carnations in the jar. Lucas took some more from his garden, which had a total of 15 carnations. After adding the carnations from his garden to the jar, the total number of carnations in the jar became 27. To find out how many carnations Lucas took from the garden, we can set up the equation: 12 (initial) + x (flowers taken) = 27 (total after taking). Solving for x gives us x = 27 - 12 = 15. Thus, Lucas took all 15 from his garden. Since he started with 15 in the garden and took all of them, there are now 15 - 15 = 0 left in the garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: There were 14 gardenias in the pot. Laura threw away 6 gardenias from the pot and cut some fresh gardenias from her garden to put in the pot. There are now 12 gardenias in the pot. How many more gardenias did she cut than those she threw away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nStart with 14 gardenias in the pot. Laura throws away 6 gardenias, leaving 14 - 6 = 8 gardenias. She then adds some fresh gardenias. The total in the pot is now 12 gardenias. To find out how many fresh gardenias she cut, we calculate 12 - 8 = 4. Thus, Laura cut 4 fresh gardenias. Now, we need to find how many more gardenias she cut than those she threw away. She threw away 6 gardenias and cut 4 gardenias, so 4 - 6 = -2, which means she cut 2 fewer gardenias than she threw away.\nTherefore, the answer is (-2)\n\nQ: There were 30 lilies in the vase. James threw away 15 lilies from the vase and trimmed some new lilies from his patch to place in the vase. There are now 20 lilies in the vase. How many more lilies did he trim than those he threw away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 30 lilies in the vase. James threw away 15 lilies, so the number of lilies remaining was 30 - 15 = 15 lilies. After trimming and adding new lilies, there are now 20 lilies in the vase. This means that James must have added 20 - 15 = 5 new lilies. The number of lilies he trimmed is 5, and the number of lilies he threw away is 15. To find how many more lilies he trimmed than those he threw away, we subtract the number he threw away from the number he trimmed: 5 - 15 = -10. Therefore, he did not trim more lilies than he threw away; he actually trimmed 10 fewer lilies than he threw away.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQuestion: There were 21 roses in the vase.

If they distributed the same number of crayons to each student, how many crayons did each student get?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know there are 64 crayons in total. Mia and her teacher need to distribute these crayons equally among the students. To find out how many crayons each student gets, we first need to know how many students there are. Since they are dividing 8 packs of crayons, we will assume each pack contains an equal number of crayons. Given that there are 8 packs and 64 crayons in total, we can divide the total number of crayons by the number of packs to find out how many crayons are in each pack. There are 64 crayons and 8 packs, so we calculate 64 divided by 8, which gives us 8 crayons per pack. If Mia and the teacher distribute the crayons equally among the students, and if they distribute 8 crayons per pack without knowing the specific number of students initially, we can conclude each student gets 8 crayons assuming there is one student per pack. Thus, each student will receive 8 crayons. Therefore, the answer is (8).\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: Sara was collecting toys for charity. On Saturday she had several bags of toys.

If 10 butterfly species flew away for spring, how many more butterfly species stayed than those that flew away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nStart with the total number of butterfly species in the garden, which is 65. If 10 butterfly species flew away, we need to calculate how many species remained in the garden. To find this, subtract the number of species that flew away from the total: 65 - 10 = 55. Now, to find out how many more species stayed than those that flew away, we calculate the difference between the number of species that stayed (55) and those that flew away (10): 55 - 10 = 45. Therefore, there are 45 more butterfly species that stayed than those that flew away.\nTherefore, the answer is (45)\n\nQ: There were 14 gardenias in the pot. Laura threw away 6 gardenias from the pot and cut some fresh gardenias from her garden to put in the pot. There are now 12 gardenias in the pot. How many more gardenias did she cut than those she threw away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nStart with 14 gardenias in the pot. Laura throws away 6 gardenias, leaving 14 - 6 = 8 gardenias. She then adds some fresh gardenias. The total in the pot is now 12 gardenias. To find out how many fresh gardenias she cut, we calculate 12 - 8 = 4. Thus, Laura cut 4 fresh gardenias. Now, we need to find how many more gardenias she cut than those she threw away. She threw away 6 gardenias and cut 4 gardenias, so 4 - 6 = -2, which means she cut 2 fewer gardenias than she threw away.\nTherefore, the answer is (-2)\n\nQ: There were 6 orchids in the display. David picked some more orchids from his greenhouse which had a total of 36 orchids. There are now 22 orchids in the display. How many orchids did he pick?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 6 orchids in the display. After David picked some more orchids, the total in the display became 22. To find out how many orchids David picked, we can subtract the initial number of orchids from the final number: 22 - 6 = 16. Therefore, David picked 16 orchids.\nTherefore, the answer is (16)\n\nQ: Lucy the florist and her crew are getting ready for a wedding at Lucy's shop. Lucy arranged 150 roses and 400 tulips a few days ago. And she arranged 350 tulips and 130 roses yesterday. How many more tulips did Lucy arrange a few days ago compared to yesterday?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find the number of tulips Lucy arranged a few days ago. According to the information given, she arranged 400 tulips a few days ago. Next, we find out how many tulips she arranged yesterday, which is 350 tulips. Now, we will calculate the difference in the number of tulips arranged between the two days by subtracting the number of tulips arranged yesterday from the number arranged a few days ago. So, we calculate 400 tulips (a few days ago) - 350 tulips (yesterday) = 50 tulips. Therefore, Lucy arranged 50 more tulips a few days ago compared to yesterday.\nTherefore, the answer is (50)\n\nQ: There were 40 orchids in the arrangement. David got rid of 10 orchids from the arrangement and harvested some new orchids from his greenhouse to put in the arrangement. There are now 35 orchids in the arrangement. How many more orchids did he harvest than those he got rid of?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 40 orchids in the arrangement. David removed 10 orchids. So, the number of orchids left after removal is 40 - 10 = 30 orchids. David then added new orchids to the arrangement, and now there are 35 orchids in total. To find out how many new orchids were added, we set up the equation: 30 + x = 35, where x is the number of new orchids. Solving for x gives us x = 35 - 30 = 5. Thus, David harvested 5 new orchids. Now, to determine how many more orchids he harvested than the orchids he got rid of, we calculate: 5 (new orchids) - 10 (orchids removed) = -5. Since we are asked how many more he harvested than he got rid of, we report it as a negative value indicating he harvested fewer. Therefore, the answer is (-5).\nTherefore, the answer is (-5)\n\nQuestion: There were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden.

{"prompt": "Q: After enjoying a delicious lunch, they decided to visit the Eiffel Tower. There, Sarah discovered that 890 visitors had toured the Eiffel Tower that day. If there were 245 visitors the previous day and 671 visitors the day before that. How many more visitors explored the Eiffel Tower on that day than on the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many more visitors explored the Eiffel Tower on that day (890 visitors) than on the previous day (245 visitors), we will calculate the difference between these two values. We subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day: 890 - 245 = 645. Therefore, 645 more visitors explored the Eiffel Tower on that day than on the previous day.\nTherefore, the answer is (645)\n\nQ: After indulging in a sumptuous brunch, they set off to see the Statue of Liberty. There, Mia learned that 980 visitors had seen the statue that day. If the previous day had 280 visitors and the day before that saw 745 visitors. How many more visitors came to the Statue of Liberty on that day compared to the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more visitors came to the Statue of Liberty on the day Mia visited compared to the previous two days, we first need to look at the visitor numbers for each of the three days: 980 (the day Mia visited), 280 (the previous day), and 745 (the day before that). Next, we calculate the total number of visitors for the two previous days: 280 + 745 = 1025. Now, we subtract the total number of visitors from the day Mia visited (980) from the total visitors of the two previous days (1025): 1025 - 980 = 45. This means that there were 45 more visitors across the two previous days than on the day Mia visited.\nTherefore, the answer is (45)\n\nQ: After relishing a lovely lunch, they stopped by the Tower of London. There were 5 towers in the Tower of London. There, Tom learned that 620 visitors toured the Tower of London that day. If the day before had 590 visitors, how many more visitors visited the Tower of London that day than on the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many more visitors visited the Tower of London that day compared to the previous day, we need to subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the number of visitors that day. So we take the number of visitors on the recent day, which is 620, and subtract the number of visitors from the previous day, which is 590. This can be expressed as follows: 620 - 590 = 30. Thus, there were 30 more visitors that day than the day before.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\nQ: Following a refreshing afternoon snack, they made their way to the Eiffel Tower. There, Emma found out that 80 visitors explored the Eiffel Tower the day before. If 2,300 people visited the Eiffel Tower in the last 30 days, how many visitors were there on that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the number of visitors to the Eiffel Tower on the specific day mentioned, we first note that 2,300 people visited over the last 30 days. We can find the average number of visitors per day by dividing the total number of visitors by the number of days: 2,300 visitors / 30 days = 76.67 visitors/day. Next, we are given that 80 visitors explored the Eiffel Tower the day before the specific day being analyzed. We can then assume that the visitation trend might mean that the number of visitors could vary slightly from day to day. However, for the day in question, since no specific information about a change in visitor numbers is given, we can take the number of visitors from the previous day as a reliable estimate for that day, which is 80 visitors. Therefore, the answer is (80).\nTherefore, the answer is (80)\n\nQ: After a satisfying meal, they ventured to admire the Taj Mahal. There were 1000 workers involved in building the Taj Mahal. There, Ava found out that 654 visitors visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 220 visitors the previous day. How many visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors who visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days, we first note the visitor counts for the specific days mentioned. For the current day, 654 visitors were recorded. For the previous day, there were 220 visitors. Assuming that these two days are part of the 70-day period, we need to estimate the average number of visitors over these 70 days. If we take both these days into account, we would have 654 + 220 = 874 visitors over these two days. This gives us an average of 874 visitors / 2 days = 437 visitors per day for these two days. To find the estimated total visitors over 70 days, we can multiply the average daily count by the total number of days: 437 visitors/day * 70 days = 30,590 visitors. We can assume that the visitor numbers remain relatively consistent each day of the period being analyzed. Therefore, the estimated total number of visitors to the Taj Mahal within 70 days is around 30,590.\nTherefore, the answer is (30590)\n\nQ: After relishing a rich dessert, they opted to take a tour of the Taj Mahal. There, Jack noted that 420 patrons visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 380 patrons the previous day and 500 patrons the day before that. How many visited the Taj Mahal within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many patrons visited the Taj Mahal in the past 89 days, we need to compute the total based on the given visits for the last three days and estimate for the previous days. We have the following information: 500 patrons two days ago, 380 patrons one day ago, and 420 patrons today. We can average the number of patrons or assume a similar pattern continues across the previous days to extrapolate a rough estimate. It would be reasonable to calculate an average based on these three days: (500 + 380 + 420) / 3 = 433.33. We can round this number to 433 for simplicity. Now, if we assume that this average holds for each of the 89 days, we calculate the total by multiplying: 433 patrons/day * 89 days = 38,557 patrons. Therefore, the total number of patrons who visited the Taj Mahal over the past 89 days is approximately 38,557.\nTherefore, the answer is (38557)\n\nQ: After having a memorable meal, they proceeded to explore the Tower of London. There, Jake discovered that 425 visitors toured the Tower that day. The day before had 112 visitors, and the day prior to that had 397 visitors. What is the difference in visitor count for that day compared to the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the difference in visitor count for the day Jake visited the Tower of London compared to the previous 245 days, we first need to consider only the visitor counts from the last three days provided. The counts are as follows: 425 visitors (the day Jake visited), 112 visitors (the previous day), and 397 visitors (the day before that). There are no additional visitor counts provided for the previous 245 days, so we would assume they are irrelevant to the calculation of the difference. The significant data point is the count of 425 visitors on the day Jake visited, as it stands alone without comparison to any specific number from those 245 days. Therefore, we cannot determine a specific difference since we do not have a defined average or total visitor count for the previous 245 days. Thus, we can only provide the difference in counts among the known values. The average visitor count of these three days is (425 + 112 + 397) / 3 = 311.33, and comparing the latest day of 425 visitors versus this average shows there were 113.67 more visitors than the average. Since the question asks for the difference and the previous 245 days' data is not specified, we'll treat the average as a reference point without calculating it as a historic average since that data isn't provided. Hence the difference from the average would be 113.67, but as asked for the problem, we cannot truly assess the 245 previous days directly. Therefore, I conclude that more context is necessary to provide a definitive count relative to the past period.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (113.67).)\n\nQ: After enjoying a delightful breakfast, they decided to visit the Tower of London. There, Sarah discovered that 150 tourists had visited the Tower the day before. If there were 800 visitors on that day, how many more visitors came to the Tower that day than the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many more visitors came to the Tower on the day in question compared to the previous day, we start with the number of visitors on that day, which is 800. Next, we note the number of visitors from the previous day, which is 150. To find the difference, we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day: 800 - 150 = 650. Therefore, the number of additional visitors on that day compared to the previous day is 650.\nTherefore, the answer is (650)\n\nQuestion: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace.

{"prompt": "Q: After finishing their work, they decided to relax. The depth of the pit is 1.5 times Zoe's height. Zoe is 4 feet shorter than Tim. If Tim stands at 8 feet. How deep is the pit?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that Tim is 8 feet tall. Since Zoe is 4 feet shorter than Tim, we can calculate Zoe's height by subtracting 4 feet from Tim's height: 8 feet - 4 feet = 4 feet. Next, the depth of the pit is 1.5 times Zoe's height. Therefore, we multiply Zoe's height by 1.5: 1.5 * 4 feet = 6 feet. Thus, the depth of the pit is 6 feet.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: After their meeting, they decided to take a break outside.

Mia is 7 feet shorter than Greg. If Greg stands at 13 feet. How long is the stage?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the length of the stage, we start with the information given. We know Greg's height is 13 feet. Mia is 7 feet shorter than Greg. Therefore, Mia's height is Greg's height minus 7 feet, which is 13 feet - 7 feet = 6 feet. The length of the stage is 3 times Mia's height. So, we calculate the stage length as 3 * 6 feet = 18 feet.\nTherefore, the answer is (18)\n\nQ: If the tunnel is 1200 feet long and they need to reach 1800 feet. How far is the exit of the tunnel?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how far it is from the end of the tunnel to the desired length of 1800 feet. Since the tunnel itself is 1200 feet long, we can calculate the remaining distance by subtracting the length of the tunnel from the target length. Therefore, we calculate 1800 feet - 1200 feet, which equals 600 feet. Thus, the exit of the tunnel is 600 feet from the end of the tunnel to reach the desired distance.\nTherefore, the answer is (600)\n\nQ: Following an appetizing meal, they journeyed to the Great Wall of China. There, Mia observed that 330 explorers arrived at the Great Wall of China that day. If there were 295 explorers the previous day and 400 explorers the day before that. How many visited the Great Wall of China within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total number of explorers who visited the Great Wall of China in the past 89 days, we first need to gather the information we have. We know the number of explorers for the last three days: 400 explorers two days ago, 295 explorers one day ago, and 330 explorers today. However, we do not have information on the number of explorers for the 86 days prior to these three days. Without more specific data or a pattern regarding daily visitors, we cannot accurately determine the total for the entire 89-day period. If we assume only these three days of data are available and the rest are unknown, we could only add the known values for an approximate total. The sum for these three days is 400 + 295 + 330 = 1025 explorers. For a complete total of the past 89 days, we need additional information on the number of visitors on each of the preceding 86 days. Lack of that data means we can only provide the sum for the three known days, but cannot extrapolate for the entire period. Hence, the answer remains incomplete without further information.\nTherefore, the answer is (1025)\n\nQ: After finishing their workout, they decided to go for a run. The length of the track is 30 times Ava's height. Ava is 4 feet taller than Liam. If Liam stands at 11 feet, how long is the track?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine Liam's height, which is given as 11 feet. Since Ava is 4 feet taller than Liam, we add 4 feet to Liam's height: 11 feet + 4 feet = 15 feet. Now, to find the length of the track, we multiply Ava's height by 30. Therefore, the length of the track is 15 feet * 30 = 450 feet.\nTherefore, the answer is (450)\n\nQ: After exploring the cave, they decided to climb. The height of the cliff is 8 times Lisa's height. Lisa is 6 feet taller than Jake. If Jake stands at 10 feet, how high is the cliff?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine Lisa's height. We know that Jake stands at 10 feet. According to the problem, Lisa is 6 feet taller than Jake. Thus, Lisa's height is calculated as: Lisa's height = Jake's height + 6 feet = 10 feet + 6 feet = 16 feet. Next, we know that the height of the cliff is 8 times Lisa's height. Thus, the height of the cliff is calculated as: Height of the cliff = 8 * Lisa's height = 8 * 16 feet = 128 feet.\nTherefore, the answer is (128)\n\nQ: After exploring the cave, they decided to climb back up.

The cookbook featured 5 chapters, each containing 120 pages. It took Sarah 240 days to read the entire cookbook. How many chapters did she read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of pages in the cookbook. There are 5 chapters and each chapter has 120 pages, so we multiply: 5 chapters * 120 pages = 600 pages. Now, we know Sarah read 600 pages in 240 days. To find out how many pages she read per day, we divide the total pages by the number of days: 600 pages / 240 days = 2.5 pages per day. Next, since we want to find out how many chapters she read per day, we need to divide the number of pages she reads per day by the number of pages in a chapter: 2.5 pages per day / 120 pages per chapter = 0.0208333 chapters per day.

{"prompt": "Q: After a delightful lunch, they made their way to the aquarium. At the aquarium, Sarah found out that 85 people came to explore that day. The previous day, 250 visitors were recorded, and the day before that saw 130 visitors. How many visited the aquarium before that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe need to find out how many visitors came to the aquarium before the previous day. We already know the visitor counts for the last three days: 85 today, 250 yesterday, and 130 the day before yesterday. To find the number of visitors before these three days, we should consider the data given that only specifies visitors for three consecutive days, and no data is given for the day prior to these three days. Therefore, we don't have enough information to determine the exact number of visitors before these three recorded days.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (unknown).)\n\nQ: Summer is approaching and many fish species are moving to deeper waters. There were 120 fish species swimming in the lake. If 15 fish species swam away for the summer, how many more fish species remained than those that swam away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there are 120 fish species swimming in the lake. If 15 fish species swim away, we need to find out how many fish species remain in the lake. We can do this by subtracting the number of species that swam away from the initial number of species. So, we calculate: 120 - 15 = 105. Now, we need to determine how many more species remained than those that swam away. We have 105 remaining species and 15 that swam away. We now calculate the difference: 105 - 15 = 90. Therefore, 90 more fish species remained than those that swam away.\nTherefore, the answer is (90)\n\nQ: Angela collects vinyl records. She picked up 18 records from a thrift store while she discarded 60 old ones. Now she has 12 records in her collection. How many more records did Angela throw away than those she picked up from the thrift store?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nAngela picked up 18 records from the thrift store. She discarded 60 old ones. To find out how many more records she threw away than those she picked up, we need to calculate the difference between the number of records discarded and the number of records picked up: 60 (discarded) - 18 (picked up) = 42. Therefore, Angela threw away 42 more records than she picked up.\nTherefore, the answer is (42)\n\nQ: Mia nurtured 18 fish in her aquarium. After a sudden change in temperature, 7 died. How many more fish died because of the change than those that continued to live?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many fish Mia had initially in the aquarium, which is 18. Then, we consider the number of fish that died due to the sudden temperature change, which is 7. To find out how many fish are still alive, we subtract the number of fish that died from the total number of fish: 18 - 7 = 11. Now, we need to calculate how many more fish died (7) than those that continued to live (11). To get this, we subtract the number of live fish from the number of dead fish: 7 - 11 = -4. The negative sign indicates that more fish were alive than those that died.\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQ: Noah and his cousin went fishing at the lake. Together they caught fish that weighed 52 pounds. On the way home, Noah's cousin dropped 7 pounds of fish. Noah's fish now weighed 22 pounds. How much did his cousin's fish weigh now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that Noah and his cousin together caught 52 pounds of fish. Let’s denote the weight of Noah's fish as N and the weight of his cousin's fish as C. Therefore, we can write the equation: N + C = 52. Next, we know that Noah's cousin dropped 7 pounds of fish. After dropping the fish, his cousin's fish will weigh C - 7. After that, we are given that Noah's fish now weighed 22 pounds. So we can say that N = 22. Now we can substitute N in the first equation: 22 + C = 52. To find C, we can rearrange and solve for C: C = 52 - 22, which gives us C = 30. After dropping 7 pounds, we calculate the weight of the cousin's fish now: C - 7 = 30 - 7 = 23. Therefore, the answer is (23).\nTherefore, the answer is (23)\n\nQ: She then went to check the lemons being picked. She found out that they gather 55 bags per day and that each bag contains 22 lemons. How many lemons will they have after 75 days of picking?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many lemons are gathered in one day. Since they gather 55 bags per day, and each bag contains 22 lemons, we can calculate the total lemons per day by multiplying the number of bags by the number of lemons per bag: 55 bags/day * 22 lemons/bag = 1210 lemons/day. Next, we find the total number of lemons collected over 75 days. We multiply the daily total by the number of days: 1210 lemons/day * 75 days = 90750 lemons. Therefore, after 75 days of picking, they will have 90750 lemons.\nTherefore, the answer is (90750)\n\nQ: As summer ends, many fish are migrating to deeper waters. There were 120 fish species residing in the river. If 75 fish species swam away for the season, how many more fish species left than those that remained?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there are 120 fish species in the river. If 75 fish species swim away, we first need to determine the number of fish species that remain. This is calculated as 120 - 75, which equals 45 species remaining. Next, we need to find out how many more fish species left than those that remained. This is done by subtracting the remaining species from those that left, which is 75 - 45. Therefore, there are 30 more fish species that left than those that remained.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\nQ: Emma started with 18 goldfish and 5 koi in her fish tank, but her cat loved to pounce on them. Now she has 12 left. How many fish disappeared?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmma started with a total of 18 goldfish and 5 koi. To find the total number of fish she initially had, we add these two numbers together: 18 + 5 = 23. Now, we know that after some fish disappeared, she was left with 12 fish. To find out how many fish disappeared, we subtract the number of fish left from the initial total: 23 - 12 = 11. Therefore, 11 fish have disappeared.\nTherefore, the answer is (11)\n\nQuestion: Paige raised 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond but stray cats loved eating them. Now she has 2 left.

{"prompt": "Q: An assembly line can manufacture 8 bicycles every hour. It ran for 7 hours yesterday and made 10 bicycles today. What is the total number of bicycles produced?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the number of bicycles produced yesterday. The assembly line produces 8 bicycles every hour and ran for 7 hours. Therefore, the number of bicycles produced yesterday is 8 bicycles/hour * 7 hours = 56 bicycles. Next, we add the bicycles made today, which is 10 bicycles. Therefore, the total number of bicycles produced is 56 bicycles (yesterday) + 10 bicycles (today) = 66 bicycles.\nTherefore, the answer is (66)\n\nQ: A shoe factory made 70 pairs of shoes last month and 15 pairs this month. It can make 10 pairs every hour. How many hours did the factory operate in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of pairs of shoes made by the factory in both months: 70 pairs (last month) + 15 pairs (this month) = 85 pairs. Then, since the factory makes 10 pairs per hour, we can find the total hours worked by dividing the total pairs of shoes by the pairs made per hour: 85 pairs ÷ 10 pairs/hour = 8.5 hours. Therefore, the factory operated for a total of 8.5 hours.\nTherefore, the answer is ((8.5))\n\nQ: Tom was working on his science project. The project had 12 sections, each with the same number of words. It has a total of 3600 words. It took Tom 15 days to complete the project. How many words did he write per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many words Tom wrote per day, we first need to calculate the total number of words he wrote and the total number of days he spent on his project. Tom's project has 3600 words in total and took him 15 days to complete. Therefore, we divide the total number of words by the number of days: 3600 words ÷ 15 days = 240 words per day. This means Tom wrote 240 words each day while working on his project.\nTherefore, the answer is (240)\n\nQ: The car wash fundraiser made the same amount of money each day. In total in 6 days they earned 300 dollars. How much did they make per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money was made per day, we need to divide the total amount earned by the number of days. The total earnings are 300 dollars and the number of days is 6. We perform the calculation: 300 dollars ÷ 6 days = 50 dollars per day. Therefore, they made 50 dollars each day.\nTherefore, the answer is (50)\n\nQ: Sarah was working on her art project. The project consisted of 96 pieces equally distributed over 12 themes. It took Sarah 4 weeks to complete the project. How many pieces did she finish per week?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many pieces Sarah finished per week, we first need to find the total number of pieces she created and the total time taken. The total number of pieces is 96, which is distributed equally over 12 themes. Since we're only interested in the total pieces, we can skip the breakdown by theme. Next, we need to calculate how many weeks it took Sarah to complete the project, which is given as 4 weeks. Finally, we divide the total number of pieces (96) by the total number of weeks (4) to find the number of pieces completed per week. This calculation is 96 pieces / 4 weeks = 24 pieces per week.\nTherefore, the answer is (24)\n\nQ: Kevin was building a model airplane. It took him 18 days to finish it.

{"prompt": "Q: A bakery had a total of 24 pastries of which 12 were chocolate croissants and the rest were fruit tarts. They also had 40 cookies. How many fruit tarts did they have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the number of fruit tarts, we need to first determine how many pastries are fruit tarts. We know that the total number of pastries is 24 and that there are 12 chocolate croissants. Therefore, we can calculate the number of fruit tarts by subtracting the number of chocolate croissants from the total number of pastries: 24 (total pastries) - 12 (chocolate croissants) = 12 (fruit tarts).\nTherefore, the answer is (12)\n\nQ: Lisa is making cookies. The recipe needs 6 cups of chocolate chips and 14 cups of oats. She has already put in some oats. If she still needs 8 more cups of oats, how many cups of oats did she put in?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe total amount of oats needed for the recipe is 14 cups. Lisa has already put in some oats, and she still needs 8 more cups. To find out how many cups of oats she has already added, we can use the equation: Total oats needed - Oats remaining = Oats added. Substituting the known values: 14 cups - 8 cups = 6 cups. Therefore, Lisa has put in 6 cups of oats.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: Emma was helping her sister bake cookies in 5 trays. They made 25 cookies altogether. If they placed the same number of cookies on each tray, how many cookies did they place on each tray?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that Emma and her sister made 25 cookies and placed them on 5 trays. To find out how many cookies were placed on each tray, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of trays. So, we perform the calculation: 25 cookies ÷ 5 trays = 5 cookies per tray. This means that each tray has the same number of cookies, which is 5.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Liam was helping his sister bake cookies and together they mixed some ingredients. They added 15 chocolate chips in each batch. If they made 8 batches, how many chocolate chips did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of chocolate chips used, we need to multiply the number of chocolate chips added in each batch by the number of batches made. Given that there are 15 chocolate chips in each batch and 8 batches were made, we perform the multiplication: 15 chocolate chips/batch * 8 batches = 120 chocolate chips. Therefore, the total number of chocolate chips used is 120.\nTherefore, the answer is (120)\n\nQ: Sarah was baking cookies. Each batch had 24 cookies and it took Sarah 2 days to bake each batch. If she takes 48 days to bake all batches, how many batches did she bake?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many batches Sarah baked, we need to determine the total time taken to bake all the batches and how many batches are completed in that time. Each batch takes 2 days to bake. Sarah took a total of 48 days to bake all batches. We can find the number of batches by dividing the total time by the time taken for each batch. So we calculate 48 days divided by 2 days per batch. This gives us: 48 / 2 = 24 batches. Therefore, Sarah baked 24 batches of cookies.\nTherefore, the answer is (24)\n\nQ: Lisa wants to bake cookies for her 15 classmates. If each bag of chocolate chips contains 5 cups, how many bags does she need to have enough for all the cookies?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many bags of chocolate chips Lisa needs, we first need to establish how many cups of chocolate chips are required for the cookies. If we assume that for each classmate, Lisa will bake a certain number of cookies that collectively require a specific amount of chocolate chips, we need that information to proceed. Let's say, hypothetically, that each cookie requires a quarter cup of chocolate chips and she intends to bake 2 cookies per classmate, which would mean 30 cookies total. Therefore, 30 cookies multiplied by 0.25 cups per cookie equals 7.5 cups of chocolate chips needed. Since each bag contains 5 cups, we divide the total cups needed (7.5) by the amount per bag (5). This results in 1.5 bags. Since you cannot purchase half a bag, Lisa will need to round up to 2 bags to ensure she has enough chocolate chips to meet her requirement for 30 cookies. Thus, the answer is 2 bags.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQ: In Ava's team, 7 are kids who enjoy baking. If Ava has 25 cookies and wants to keep 15 cookies for herself. How many will each of the kids receive?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many cookies Ava has left after keeping some for herself. She has 25 cookies and decides to keep 15 for herself. We subtract the number of cookies she keeps from the total: 25 - 15 = 10 cookies. Next, we need to find out how many cookies each of the 7 kids will receive. We will divide the remaining cookies by the number of kids: 10 cookies ÷ 7 kids = approximately 1.4286 cookies per kid. Since we typically cannot divide cookies into fractions for distribution, we can consider providing 1 cookie to each kid, and there will be 3 cookies left over. Thus, each of the 7 kids will effectively receive 1 cookie, and 3 cookies will remain undistributed.\nTherefore, the answer is (1)\n\nQ: Jake was helping his sister bake cookies and together they made 24 batches. They used 6 ingredients in each batch and only 30 cookies came out perfect from each batch.

{"prompt": "Q: David and his aunt went cherry picking. Together they collected cherries that weighed 19 pounds. On the way back, David's aunt found 6 more pounds of cherries. David's cherries now weighed 22 pounds. How much did his aunt's cherries weigh now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, David and his aunt collected cherries weighing a total of 19 pounds. Let's denote David's weight of cherries as D and his aunt's weight of cherries as A. Therefore, we have the equation D + A = 19. Later, David's aunt found 6 more pounds of cherries, increasing her total weight of cherries to A + 6. Now, David reports that his cherries weigh 22 pounds. Therefore, D = 22. Substituting this value into the first equation gives us 22 + A = 19. Solving for A, we find A = 19 - 22, which gives A = -3. However, we need to take into account the 6 additional pounds that the aunt found. Therefore, her new total would be A + 6 = (-3) + 6 = 3 pounds. Hence, David's aunt's cherries weigh 3 pounds now.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: Lisa and her dad went blueberry picking. They collected blueberries that weighed 50 pounds together. On the way back, Lisa's dad lost 10 pounds of blueberries. Lisa's blueberries now weighed 18 pounds. How much did her dad's blueberries weigh now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Lisa and her dad collected a total of 50 pounds of blueberries. After Lisa's dad lost 10 pounds, the total weight of blueberries they had was 50 - 10 = 40 pounds. We also know that Lisa's blueberries weigh 18 pounds now. Therefore, the weight of her dad's blueberries is the new total weight of blueberries (40 pounds) minus the weight of Lisa's blueberries (18 pounds). Thus, her dad's blueberries now weigh 40 - 18 = 22 pounds.\nTherefore, the answer is (22)\n\nQ: Lily and her mom went apple picking. Together they collected apples that weighed 18 pounds. On the way back, Lily's mom found 25 more pounds of apples. Lily's apples now weighed 30 pounds. How much did her mom's apples weigh now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Lily and her mom collected a total of 18 pounds of apples. When her mom found 25 more pounds of apples, we need to determine the total weight of apples both collected. After finding the additional apples, Lily's apples alone weighed 30 pounds. Hence, we can calculate the mom's apples. First, let's denote the initial weight of mommy's apples as 'x'. From their initial collection, we know: x + (weight of Lily's apples) = 18 pounds. Since Lily's apples now weigh 30 pounds, we first need to determine what her initial weight was. Since the combined weight of their initial collection was 18 pounds, we can calculate: x + (initial weight of Lily's apples) = 18, so (initial weight of Lily's apples) = 18 - x. Since now Lily's weight is increased to 30 pounds, the additional weight added to Lily's apples from initial collection can be calculated as (30 - (18 - x)). Now if mom found an additional 25 pounds, the total weight of mom's apples now is: x + 25 pounds. Therefore, to find the current weight of mom's apples, we can express it in terms of the initial weight of apples collected: x + 25 = (30 - (18 - x)) + 25. By isolating the variables we can solve for 'x'. However, to find just mom's current weight without determining 'x', we can see Lily's increase and knowing the additional amount found. So if initially x was part of collection as 18, with 25 added makes her total higher. And to finalize, 30 - 18 is +12, indicating every pound found maxed her at 30. Thus mom's can be said slightly bounded by the logic increasing to +25 again special weight now to account from base before. Thus the mom's apples current weight = 30 - (18 - (18 - 18+x)) + 25 = 12. Hence this reflects a combined final balance directly back toward how many could sum we'd find by transition now. Hence x entirely transitioned back legitimating equals values from 30 + 25 would simplify again, restoring just how much this holds as an equation rather than needing exact determination for individual x varies back. So answers interpreted mean to share doubled plus confirms this fruit rounding captures this balance, centering logic relative gains. Final resolution seeks to validate mom's = 30 after adjustments were +25 worth collectively = thus totaling into a 43x from gaining here. \nTherefore, the answer is (43)\n\nQ: Sophia and her mom went to the orchard. They together harvested peaches that weighed 60 pounds. On the way home, Sophia's mom lost 15 pounds of peaches. Sophia's peaches now weighed 20 pounds. How much did her mom's peaches weigh now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \n1. Sophia and her mom together harvested 60 pounds of peaches.\n2. Sophia's peaches now weigh 20 pounds.\n3. To find out how much peaches her mom originally had, we subtract Sophia's peaches from the total harvested: 60 - 20 = 40 pounds.\n4. Initially, her mom had 40 pounds of peaches.\n5. On the way home, her mom lost 15 pounds of peaches.\n6. We subtract the lost weight from her mom's original amount: 40 - 15 = 25 pounds.\n7. Therefore, the current weight of her mom's peaches is 25 pounds.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: Ryan and his grandma went cucumber picking. Together they collected cucumbers that weighed 20 pounds. On the way back, Ryan's grandma found 15 more pounds of cucumbers. Ryan's cucumbers now weighed 25 pounds. How much did his grandma's cucumbers weigh now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \n1. Initially, Ryan and his grandma collected cucumbers weighing a total of 20 pounds. \n2. Let's denote the weight of Ryan's cucumbers as R and the weight of his grandma's cucumbers as G. Thus, we have the equation R + G = 20. \n3. On the way back, Ryan's grandma found 15 more pounds of cucumbers, which increases the weight of her cucumbers: G + 15. \n4. We know that Ryan's cucumbers now weigh 25 pounds. This means that the weight of Ryan's cucumbers has increased by 5 pounds since they were originally 20 pounds combined with his grandma's cucumbers. Therefore, we can set R = 25. \n5. From the first equation, we can substitute R into it: 25 + G = 20. \n6. Rearranging this gives G = 20 - 25, which simplifies to G = -5, contradicting the context, indicating a misunderstanding of initial conditions. \n7. Upon realizing this, we reevaluate: The initial 20 pounds include both their cucumbers, and with the grandma's added weights, the total becomes G + 15, where G was initially not specified. \n8. Thus, we say the grandma had some amount, and with her new cucumbers, we set: G (initial) + 15 (new) = G_final. \n9. We conclude Ryan garnered additional cucumbers making, the grandmother's total now reflected by G + 15 pounds.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\nQ: Sophia and her dad went pumpkin picking. Together they collected pumpkins that weighed 24 pounds. On the way back, Sophia's dad found 35 more pounds of pumpkins. Sophia's pumpkins now weighed 40 pounds. How much did her dad's pumpkins weigh now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Sophia and her dad collected pumpkins weighing a total of 24 pounds. Let us denote the weight of Sophia's pumpkins as S and her dad's pumpkins as D. Therefore, we can set up the equation: S + D = 24. Later, Sophia's dad found an additional 35 pounds of pumpkins, which increases the weight of his pumpkins to (D + 35). We know that after this, Sophia's pumpkins weighed 40 pounds, which implies that her initial pumpkins must recount now as D + 35 = 24 - S + 35. However, we are interested only in the dad's pumpkins after he found the extra 35 pounds. We solve for D: initially, D = 24 - S and then we know S = 40, thus D = 24 - 40, giving D a value of -16, which is not logical in this case. Thus, we need to reconcile the weights to find out the dad's total post-collection. After examining, D must incorporate the weight gained from 35 pounds, thus D becomes D + 35 where D originally must have been calculated to balance with Sophia's. Therefore, the dad's pumpkins weigh now (D + 35) as we established earlier, computing results in D + 35 = 40 - 24 + 35 means dad must account for at least an original weight of 16 to yield 24 with Sophia weighing 40 gives us a final dad's count. We finalize that initially dad's weight we must assume retained should logically come through to D's calculations returning (24 + 35) pounds ultimately in collection making dad's account finalized as 35 pounds.\nTherefore, the answer is (35)\n\nQ: Ryan and his dad went to a farmer's market. They bought vegetables that weighed 40 pounds combined. On the way home, Ryan's dad lost 10 pounds of vegetables. Ryan's vegetables now weighed 14 pounds. How much did his dad's vegetables weigh now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet's define the weight of the vegetables Ryan bought as R and the weight of his dad's vegetables as D. We know that R + D = 40 pounds. After losing some vegetables, Ryan's dad now has D - 10 pounds of vegetables. Ryan's vegetables are now given to weigh 14 pounds. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:\n1. R + D = 40\n2. R = 14\nIf we substitute R in the first equation:\n14 + D = 40\nThis simplifies to D = 40 - 14 = 26 pounds. Now, after Ryan's dad lost 10 pounds of vegetables, he now has:\nD - 10 = 26 - 10 = 16 pounds. Thus, the weight of Ryan's dad's vegetables now is 16 pounds.\nTherefore, the answer is (16)\n\nQ: James and his sister went berry picking. Together they collected blueberries that weighed 16 pounds. On the way back, James's sister found 20 more pounds of blueberries. James's blueberries now weighed 28 pounds. How much did his sister's blueberries weigh now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, James and his sister collected a total of 16 pounds of blueberries together. If we let J represent the weight of James's blueberries and S represent the weight of his sister's blueberries, we have: J + S = 16. After finding 20 more pounds of blueberries, James's sister now has S + 20 pounds of blueberries. Given that James's blueberries now weigh 28 pounds, we know that J must also equal 28 pounds. We can now use these equations: 1) J + S = 16 and 2) J = 28. Substituting J in the first equation gives us: 28 + S = 16. Solving for S, we find S = 16 - 28, which results in a negative weight (impossible). Therefore, we need to reconsider the problem. Since James's blueberries were initially part of the 16 pounds and he now has 28 pounds after the sister found 20 more pounds, these 28 pounds include the amount he had originally. Therefore, by using J = 28 pounds, we confirm his sister initially had S = 16 - J = 16 - 28 = -12 (impossible). Since he originally had 12 pounds (from deductive reasoning now), and after 20 more were found, his sister then has: S_final = original S + 20 = 12 + 20 = 32 pounds. Thus, after all calculations, James's sister’s blueberries weigh now 32 pounds.\nTherefore, the answer is (32)\n\nQuestion: Marco and his dad went strawberry picking.

{"prompt": "Q: Tom's aunt cooked pizzas for 6. She baked 24 pizzas but had to toss 15 pizzas. If each of them was given the same number of pizzas, how many did each of them receive?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTom's aunt baked 24 pizzas and tossed 15 of them, which means she has 24 - 15 = 9 pizzas left. There are 6 people in total, so we need to divide the remaining pizzas by the number of people: 9 pizzas ÷ 6 people = 1.5 pizzas per person. Therefore, each person received the same number of pizzas.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (1.5).)\n\nQ: He then went to see the grapes being picked. He found out that they gather 80 baskets per day and that each basket contains 20 grapes. How many grapes are picked if they gather a total of 40 baskets of grapes?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of grapes picked when 40 baskets are gathered, we first need to know how many grapes are in one basket. According to the information provided, each basket contains 20 grapes. So, the total number of grapes can be calculated by multiplying the number of baskets (40) by the number of grapes in each basket (20). This gives us the equation: 40 baskets * 20 grapes/basket = 800 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes picked is 800.\nTherefore, the answer is (800)\n\nQ: He then visited the field to see the tomatoes being gathered. He learned that they collect 20 crates of unripe tomatoes and 15 crates of ripe tomatoes per day. How many crates of ripe tomatoes will they have after 50 days of collection?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many crates of ripe tomatoes will be gathered after 50 days, we first identify the daily collection of ripe tomatoes, which is 15 crates per day. Next, we multiply the daily collection by the total number of days: 15 crates/day * 50 days = 750 crates. Therefore, after 50 days of collection, they will have 750 crates of ripe tomatoes.\nTherefore, the answer is (750)\n\nQ: Ava picked 11 ripe grapes from her vine. Now the vine has 4 grapes still on it. If 2 of those are ripe and the rest are unripe. How many unripe grapes does the vine have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nAva picked 11 ripe grapes from her vine, and now there are 4 grapes left on the vine. Out of these 4 grapes left, 2 are ripe. To find the number of unripe grapes, we can subtract the number of ripe grapes from the total number of grapes left on the vine. Total grapes left = 4, Ripe grapes = 2. Therefore, the number of unripe grapes = Total grapes - Ripe grapes = 4 - 2 = 2.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQ: A farmer had 300 bell peppers in his garden.

If he picked 80 of them yesterday and 45 today. How many did he have left after yesterday's picking?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe orchard keeper started with 250 peaches. After picking 80 peaches yesterday, we need to subtract that number from the original amount. So, we calculate: 250 - 80 = 170 peaches left after yesterday's picking.\nTherefore, the answer is (170)\n\nQ: The farm is organizing a harvest festival. The farm has 22 fields. There are 24 workers and a total of 88 crops to harvest. If all fields are worked on, how many crops are in each field?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many crops are in each field, we need to divide the total number of crops by the total number of fields. The total number of crops is 88 and the total number of fields is 22. We perform the division: 88 crops ÷ 22 fields = 4 crops per field. Therefore, each field will have an equal amount of crops harvested. \nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQ: He then went to witness the tomatoes being collected. He found out that they harvest 45 buckets per day and that each bucket contains 20 tomatoes. How many buckets of tomatoes will they have after 15 days of collection?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many buckets of tomatoes are collected each day. The information given states that 45 buckets are harvested per day. Next, we need to find out how many buckets will be harvested over a span of 15 days. To do this, we multiply the daily collection by the number of days: 45 buckets/day * 15 days = 675 buckets.

{"prompt": "Q: The rainy season is about to end and many birds are starting to settle back. 14 bird families returned to their nests after the rainy season. If there were 50 bird families living in the area initially. How many bird families were left in the area?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 50 bird families in the area. After the rainy season, 14 bird families returned to their nests. To find out how many bird families are left in the area, we need to subtract the number of bird families that returned from the initial total. Therefore, we perform the calculation: 50 - 14 = 36.

There were 76 whale families near the coast. If 9 whale families swam away for migration, how many more whale families stayed behind than those that swam away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 76 whale families. Then, 9 whale families swam away for migration. To find the number of whale families that stayed behind, we need to subtract the number of families that swam away from the total number of families. So, we calculate: 76 - 9 = 67. Now, we need to determine how many more whale families stayed behind than those that swam away. We compare the families that stayed (67) with those that migrated (9): 67 - 9 = 58. Thus, there are 58 more whale families that stayed behind than those that swam away.\nTherefore, the answer is (58)\n\nQ: The dry season is starting, and several insect families are moving to moist areas. There were 90 insect families in the field. If 20 insect families flew away for the dry season, how many more insect families stayed behind than those that flew away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we start with the total number of insect families, which is 90. We know that 20 insect families flew away. To find the number of insect families that stayed behind, we subtract the number of families that flew away from the total number of families: 90 - 20 = 70. Now, to determine how many more families stayed behind than those that flew away, we subtract the number of families that flew away from the number that stayed: 70 - 20 = 50. Therefore, there are 50 more insect families that stayed behind than those that flew away.\nTherefore, the answer is (50)\n\nQ: Fall is nearly here and many insects are preparing to burrow for the cold season. 50 insect families left for warmer climates from the garden. If there were 25 insect families living in the garden initially, how many more insect families left than those that remained?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 25 insect families living in the garden. 50 insect families left for warmer climates. Therefore, the number of insect families that remained in the garden is 25 - the number that left. Since 50 insect families left and only 25 were present, all 25 families must have left first. The total number of families that left is 50, and since all 25 families initially present left, we calculate how many more left than remained: 50 (left) - 0 (remained) = 50. Therefore, the number of insect families that left is higher by 50 than those that remained in the garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (50)\n\nQ: Summer is approaching and many animals are returning from their winter habitats. 60 fish species swam back to the rivers near the lake. If there were 30 fish species living in the lake initially, how many more fish species returned than those that remained?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that there were initially 30 fish species living in the lake. When 60 fish species returned to the rivers near the lake, we can determine how many species remained by subtracting the initial species from those that returned. The number of species that returned is 60 and those that remained in the lake is 30. Now, to find how many more fish species returned than those that remained, we calculate the difference between the number of species that returned and those that remained: 60 (returned) - 30 (remained) = 30. Thus, 30 more fish species returned than those that remained.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\nQ: Spring is coming and a lot of butterflies are migrating to greener areas. There were 65 butterfly species in the garden. If 10 butterfly species flew away for spring, how many more butterfly species stayed than those that flew away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nStart with the total number of butterfly species in the garden, which is 65. If 10 butterfly species flew away, we need to calculate how many species remained in the garden. To find this, subtract the number of species that flew away from the total: 65 - 10 = 55. Now, to find out how many more species stayed than those that flew away, we calculate the difference between the number of species that stayed (55) and those that flew away (10): 55 - 10 = 45. Therefore, there are 45 more butterfly species that stayed than those that flew away.\nTherefore, the answer is (45)\n\nQ: When the rainy season approaches, numerous bird species are moving to coastal areas. There were 80 bird species nesting in the forest. If 40 bird species migrated for the rain, how many more bird species flew away than those that remained?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with 80 bird species nesting in the forest. When the rainy season approaches, 40 bird species migrate away from the forest to coastal areas. To find out how many more bird species flew away than those that remained, we first calculate how many species remained after migration. The number of species that remained in the forest is 80 - 40 = 40 species. Now, we compare the number that flew away (40 species) to those that remained (40 species). The difference is 40 - 40 = 0. Therefore, there are no more bird species that flew away than those that remained.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: The rainy months have begun, and many bird families are relocating to drier regions. There were 110 bird families nesting in the trees.

Out of these, 25 bird families left for the drier months. To find out how many bird families stayed behind, we need to subtract the number of families that left from the initial number: 110 - 25 = 85. Now, we need to find out how many more bird families stayed behind than those that left. We calculate this by subtracting the number of families that left from the number that stayed: 85 - 25 = 60. Therefore, 60 more bird families stayed behind than those that left.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQuestion: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain.

After giving some to her cousin, she now owns 250 items left. How many more dolls than bears does Alice have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Alice had 300 dolls and 200 bears, making a total of 500 items. After giving some away, she has 250 items left. This means Alice gave away 500 - 250 = 250 items. Let D be the number of dolls Alice has left and B be the number of bears she has left. The total of the remaining dolls and bears is given by the equation D + B = 250. Since she started with 300 dolls, the number of dolls she gave away is 300 - D. Similarly, since she started with 200 bears, the number of bears she gave away is 200 - B. The difference between the remaining dolls and bears is given by the equation D - B. To find how many more dolls than bears Alice has, we can also express this in terms of how many she gave away. But in order to solve for any specific deal, we only need the relationship of the items left. Therefore, the exact numbers of dolls and bears left are D = 250 + (200 - B) and B + D = 250. Without knowing B directly, we can see the breakdown of their differences leads to understanding how many more dolls she has than bears ultimately by calculating D - B directly after establishing initial distributions.\nTherefore, the answer is (50)\n\nQ: Anna got a box of 130 crayons for her birthday.

Next, we look at the number of crayons she donated to charity, which is 60. To find out how many more crayons she lost than those she donated, we perform the subtraction: 100 (lost) - 60 (donated) = 40. This means Anna lost 40 more crayons than she donated.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: Mike collects model cars. He had 520 cars and 410 trucks. After trading some with Peter, he is left with 410 vehicles. How many more model cars than trucks does Mike have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMike initially had a total of 520 model cars and 410 trucks, which sums up to 930 vehicles. After trading with Peter, he has 410 vehicles remaining. This means a total of 930 - 410 = 520 vehicles were traded away. Let x represent the number of cars Mike has left after the trade and y represent the number of trucks left after the trade. The total number of vehicles Mike has after the trade is x + y = 410. Mike originally had 520 cars and traded away (520 - x) cars, and he had 410 trucks and traded away (410 - y) trucks. Therefore, we also know that (520 - x) + (410 - y) = 520, simplifying to 520 - x + 410 - y = 520, which leads to x + y = 410. We need to find the difference, x - y. Given x + y = 410 and the total number of cars and trucks initially, Mike had more cars than trucks. We know that x + y = 410 helps guide our understanding of the distribution after trades but we cannot ascertain the specific breakdown without additional information about how many were traded. Therefore, we can conclude the number of model cars is still greater than the number of trucks. Since the number of model cars reduced from 520 and trucks from 410, let's consider that Mike always has more cars than trucks. Therefore, the difference cannot be determined without specific vehicle counts post-trade but is logically more than 0. Thus, knowing that Mike originally had 110 more cars than trucks (520 - 410), and he traded some of them but is left with more cars than trucks, it can be estimated that he likely has a minimum of 200 cars left compared to 210 trucks. Ultimately, we need to conclude that Mike has at least 10 more cars than trucks regardless of how many he ended up trading away.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Tom has a collection of stamps. Initially, he owned 125 vintage stamps and 190 modern stamps. After giving some to Sara, he has 215 stamps left. How many more vintage stamps than modern stamps does Tom have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTom initially has 125 vintage stamps and 190 modern stamps, totaling 125 + 190 = 315 stamps. After giving some to Sara, he has 215 stamps left. This means he has given away 315 - 215 = 100 stamps. Let the number of vintage stamps he gave to Sara be v and the number of modern stamps be m. Hence, v + m = 100. After giving away the stamps, Tom has 125 - v vintage stamps and 190 - m modern stamps. To find the difference between the vintage and modern stamps left, we need to calculate: (125 - v) - (190 - m) = (125 - v) - 190 + m = (m - v) - 65. We also know that m = 100 - v from the first equation, so substituting this into the difference calculation gives us: ((100 - v) - v) - 65 = 100 - 2v - 65 = 35 - 2v. This difference now depends on the value of v. In particular, the more vintage stamps v he gives away, the more modern stamps he keeps, and vice versa.\nTherefore, the answer is (35)\n\nQ: Jack was gifted a collection of 200 marbles for his birthday. During the summer, he gave away 50 marbles to his neighbors while he lost 125 marbles. How many more marbles did he lose than those he gave away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nJack initially had 200 marbles. He gave away 50 marbles to his neighbors. Then, he lost 125 marbles. To find out how many more marbles he lost than those he gave away, we subtract the number of marbles given away from the number of marbles lost: 125 (lost) - 50 (given away) = 75. Therefore, he lost 75 more marbles than he gave away.\nTherefore, the answer is (75)\n\nQ: Laura was given a collection of 95 toy cars for her birthday. Throughout the month, she handed 35 toy cars to her siblings while she lost 78 toy cars. How many more toy cars did she lose than the ones she handed out?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many toy cars Laura handed out and how many she lost. Laura handed out a total of 35 toy cars to her siblings. She lost 78 toy cars. To find out how many more toy cars she lost than she handed out, we calculate the difference between the number of toy cars she lost and the number she handed out: 78 (lost) - 35 (handed out) = 43. Therefore, Laura lost 43 more toy cars than she handed out.\nTherefore, the answer is (43)\n\nQ: Lisa gathers postcards. She began with 310 postcards and 290 greeting cards. After sending some to her friends, she has 250 cards left. How many more postcards than greeting cards does Lisa have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLisa started with 310 postcards and 290 greeting cards, giving her a total of 310 + 290 = 600 cards. After sending some to her friends, she has 250 cards left. This means she sent 600 - 250 = 350 cards to her friends. We need to determine how many postcards and greeting cards Lisa has left. Let x be the number of postcards and y be the number of greeting cards Lisa has after sending some. We know that x + y = 250 (total cards left). Lisa started with 310 postcards and if she sent s postcards, then she has x = 310 - s postcards left. Similarly, if she sent t greeting cards, then she has y = 290 - t greeting cards left. Since s + t = 350 (total cards sent), we can derive the equations. But we need to find x - y (the difference between the number of postcards and greeting cards). From the equations x + y = 250, replacing y gives us x + (290 - t) = 250. From this, we can get x - t = 250 - 290, simplifying to x - t = -40. For simplicity, we need to assume how many of each card she sent as we lack specific constraints. Assuming she sent postcards and greeting cards in a way that maximizes the leftovers, if she sent all greeting cards, she would have y = 0, leading to x = 250. Thus, the difference x - y = 250 - 0 = 250. Alternatively, if she sent equally, she could send 175 greeting and 175 postcards, leading to x = 135 and y = 115, giving x - y = 135 - 115 = 20. Regardless, post simplification, the standard is if maximized postcards vs decreased, leading generally to more postcards will generally lead toward the answer of 20. \nTherefore, the answer is (20)\n\nQuestion: Nell collects cards.

{"prompt": "Q: After a flood, 8 shrubs in Noah's yard drowned. If he had planted 2 shrubs initially. How many more shrubs drowned in the flood than those that survived?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nNoah initially planted 2 shrubs. After the flood, a total of 8 shrubs drowned. To find out how many more shrubs drowned than survived, first, we need to calculate how many survived: 2 initial shrubs - 0 surviving shrubs = 2 surviving shrubs. Now, we calculate the difference between the number of drowned shrubs and the surviving shrubs: 8 drowned - 2 survived = 6 more shrubs drowned than survived.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: After a storm, 15 flowers in Mia's garden wilted. If she had planted 5 flowers initially. How many more flowers wilted in the storm than those that thrived?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMia initially planted 5 flowers in her garden. After the storm, 15 flowers wilted. Since she only planted 5 flowers, it indicates that more flowers wilted than those that thrived. To find out how many more wilted than thrived, we first determine that 5 flowers thrived, given that she cannot have more than what she planted. We then calculate the difference: 15 wilted - 5 thrived = 10. Therefore, 10 more flowers wilted than thrived.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Laura was given a collection of 95 toy cars for her birthday. Throughout the month, she handed 35 toy cars to her siblings while she lost 78 toy cars.

Laura handed out a total of 35 toy cars to her siblings. She lost 78 toy cars. To find out how many more toy cars she lost than she handed out, we calculate the difference between the number of toy cars she lost and the number she handed out: 78 (lost) - 35 (handed out) = 43. Therefore, Laura lost 43 more toy cars than she handed out.\nTherefore, the answer is (43)\n\nQ: Following a freeze, 12 vegetables in Emma's plot died. If she had sown 6 vegetables initially. How many more vegetables died in the freeze than those that lived?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Emma sowed 6 vegetables. After the freeze, 12 vegetables died. To find out how many lived, we need to compare the number of vegetables that died to those that lived. Since 12 vegetables died and only 6 were initially sown, it implies that all the vegetables that were sown did not survive, leading to 0 vegetables living. Now, we can calculate how many more vegetables died than those that lived: 12 (died) - 0 (lived) = 12. Therefore, 12 more vegetables died than those that lived.\nTherefore, the answer is (12)\n\nQ: Laura was revisiting her beloved poetry collection. The collection featured 7 chapters, each with an equal number of pages. It has a total of 420 pages. It took Laura 365 days to read through the collection. How many pages are in each chapter?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the number of pages in each chapter, we first divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters. The total number of pages in the collection is 420, and there are 7 chapters. We calculate the number of pages per chapter by performing the division: 420 pages ÷ 7 chapters = 60 pages per chapter.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQ: Claire owned 8 plants in her garden. She purchased 22 additional plants. After giving some away, she had 14 plants left. How many more plants did she give away than she purchased?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nClaire initially owned 8 plants and purchased 22 more, which means she had 8 + 22 = 30 plants in total. After giving some plants away, she ended up with 14 plants left. To find out how many plants she gave away, we calculate the difference between the total plants she had and the plants she has left: 30 - 14 = 16 plants. This means she gave away 16 plants. Now, to find out how many more plants she gave away than she purchased, we compare the number of plants she gave away (16) to the number of plants she purchased (22). The number of plants she gave away (16) is 22 - 16 = 6 plants less than what she purchased. Therefore, she did not give away more; instead, she gave away 6 plants less than she purchased. Since the question focuses on how many more she gave away than purchased, the result is negative. Thus, the answer is -6, indicating how many fewer plants were given away.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (-6).)\n\nQ: In the wake of a wildfire, 20 bushes in Ava's estate burned. If she had cultivated 10 bushes initially. How many more bushes burned in the wildfire than those that remained?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nAva initially cultivated 10 bushes. After the wildfire, 20 bushes burned in total. Since she only had 10 bushes initially, all of those bushes burned. Therefore, the number of bushes that remained is 0 (because 10 bushes burned). Now, we need to find how many more bushes burned than those that remained. The number of bushes that burned is 20, and the number of bushes that remained is 0. Therefore, the difference is 20 - 0 = 20. Hence, 20 more bushes burned than those that remained.\nTherefore, the answer is (20)\n\nQ: After a hail storm, 5 fruit trees in Oliver's orchard suffered damage. If he had planted 3 trees initially. How many more trees suffered damage in the hail storm than those that were unaffected?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nOliver initially planted 3 fruit trees in his orchard. After the hail storm, 5 trees suffered damage. To find out how many trees were unaffected, we first identify how many trees are accounted for in total. Since 5 trees suffered damage, we need to compare this with the initial 3 trees planted. The number of unaffected trees is the difference between the total damaged and the trees planted, which results in a negative value since the damaged trees exceed those initially planted. Hence, we consider that there are no unaffected trees, and therefore the only comparison is between 5 damaged trees and 0 unaffected trees. The difference is 5 - 0 = 5. Thus, 5 more trees suffered damage than those that remained unaffected.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQuestion: After a typhoon, 13 trees in Haley's backyard died.

She needs 25 g of frosting for immediate use. To find out how much frosting is needed in total for the cake decorations, we look at the frosting that is required right now, which is 25 g. Since this is the only specified need at the moment, the total grams of frosting required for decoration is simply this amount. Thus, there isn't any additional information that suggests she needs more than the 25 g stated. Therefore, we conclude that the total grams of frosting required for the cake decorations is 25 g.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: Next on his checklist is cement to fix the tiles in place.

He needs 40 g of cement right now for the tiles. \n3. To find out how much cement is required in total for the tiles, we need to identify if the 40 g is the only requirement or just a part of a larger requirement. \n4. Since the question only mentions 40 g is what's needed at the moment, and does not imply that this is the full requirement, we conclude that we do not know the total requirement without additional context. \n5. Therefore, we cannot accurately determine if the full requirement for cement is greater than 40 g or if it is exactly 40 g, but based solely on the information given, the immediate need is 40 g.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: Next on his checklist is paint to color the canvas.

{"prompt": "Q: James collects action figures and comics. He found 10 action figures and 15 comics at the toy store. Now he owns 8 action figures and 20 comics in his collection. How many comics did James have at the start?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many comics James initially had, we will analyze the information given. We know that James found 10 action figures and 15 comics at the toy store. Hence, after acquiring these, the total for action figures would be 8 + 10 = 18 and the total for comics would be 20 + 15 = 35. Since he now owns 20 comics, we can deduce that he initially had some comics before the purchase. We can set up an equation where C is the number of comics James had initially: C + 15 = 20. We can solve for C by subtracting 15 from both sides, leading us to C = 20 - 15. Thus, C = 5. Therefore, James initially had 5 comics before he made the purchase.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Michael can stack 20 DVDs on each shelf in his entertainment center.

After donating some to a charity, he has 400 toys remaining. How many more action figures than figurines does James have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nJames originally had 450 action figures and 370 figurines, making a total of 450 + 370 = 820 toys. After donating some, he now has 400 toys remaining. The number of toys donated is 820 - 400 = 420. We do not know how many action figures or figurines were donated. Let 'x' be the number of action figures donated and 'y' be the number of figurines donated. Therefore, we have two equations: (1) x + y = 420 (total donated) and (2) (450 - x) + (370 - y) = 400 (remaining toys). From equation (2), we can simplify it to: 450 + 370 - (x + y) = 400. Since we know x + y = 420, we can substitute this into the equation to verify. Thus, we know James still has 450 - x action figures and 370 - y figurines remaining. The difference in the counts of action figures and figurines is (450 - x) - (370 - y) = 450 - 370 + y - x = 80 + y - x. To solve for y - x, substitute y = 420 - x into that equation: 80 + (420 - x) - x = 80 + 420 - 2x = 500 - 2x. However, we do not have the specific values for x and y at this point. The difference between remaining action figures and figurines as derived implies that James has more action figures than figurines. The question asks how many more action figures than figurines does James have without needing to find the actual number of each type. The difference will remain 80 + (420 - x) - x, showing that the calculation simplifies to how many more action figures he has relative to remaining figurines after donations. Thus, the result is dependent only on the original counts. Ultimately, the answer indicates James still retained a count greater in action figures over the figurines based on the number he started with and the donations adjusted.\nTherefore, the answer is (80)\n\nQuestion: Adam could fit 10 action figures on each shelf in his room.

He has 70 cookies left after he gave equal numbers of cookies to his 10 teammates. How many cookies did Aiden give to his teammates?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nAiden initially had 100 cookies. After giving some away, he has 70 cookies left. This means he gave away a total of 100 - 70 = 30 cookies. Since he has 10 teammates and he gave an equal number of cookies to each, we can divide the total cookies given away by the number of teammates: 30 cookies / 10 teammates = 3 cookies per teammate. Therefore, Aiden gave 3 cookies to each of his 10 teammates, leading to a total of 30 cookies given away.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\nQ: Lisa was baking cookies for the holidays.

To find out how many more pencils he gave to his teacher than those he broke, we subtract the number of broken pencils from the number of pencils given to the teacher: 8 (given) - 2 (broken) = 6. Therefore, Mark gave 6 more pencils to his teacher than he broke.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: Laura handed out identical quantities of cookies and muffins to her 3 neighbors. If she began with 36 cookies and 81 muffins, how many cookies did each neighbor enjoy?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many cookies and muffins Laura can give to each neighbor. She has 36 cookies and 81 muffins. Since she has 3 neighbors, we divide the total quantity of cookies and muffins by 3 to find out how many of each item each neighbor can receive. Starting with cookies, we perform the calculation: 36 cookies ÷ 3 neighbors = 12 cookies per neighbor. Now, for muffins, we perform the calculation: 81 muffins ÷ 3 neighbors = 27 muffins per neighbor. The question specifically asks for how many cookies each neighbor enjoyed, which we found to be 12 cookies. Therefore, the answer is 12.\nTherefore, the answer is (12)\n\nQ: Nina has 40 cookies.

How many more cookies were burnt in the mishap than those that were successfully baked?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nOliver baked a total of 16 cookies. Out of these, 5 cookies were burnt in the mishap. To find out how many more cookies were burnt than those that were successfully baked, we first need to calculate the number of successfully baked cookies. We do this by subtracting the burnt cookies from the total baked cookies: 16 - 5 = 11 successfully baked cookies. Now, we compare the number of burnt cookies to the successfully baked cookies: 5 (burnt) - 11 (successfully baked) = -6. Since we are looking for how many more cookies were burnt than successfully baked, the result is negative, indicating that there were actually 6 more successfully baked cookies than burnt. However, since the question specifically asks how many more were burnt than successfully baked, we express this as 6 (from the perspective that successfully baked cookies outperform burnt ones, indicating that burnt cookies are fewer).\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: Oliver was packing his snacks into 8 containers with 10 cookies and 12 crackers in each container.

{"prompt": "Q: James had 90 apples. He has 72 apples left after he gave equal numbers of apples to his 8 neighbors. How many apples did James give to his neighbors?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nJames started with 90 apples. After giving some apples away, he has 72 apples left. To find out how many apples he gave away, we calculate: 90 (initial apples) - 72 (remaining apples) = 18 apples given away. Since he gave these apples equally to 8 neighbors, we need to determine how many apples each neighbor received by dividing the total number of apples given away by the number of neighbors: 18 (total apples given) / 8 (neighbors) = 2.25 apples per neighbor. Therefore, the total number of apples given to the neighbors is 18 apples.\nTherefore, the answer is (18)\n\nQ: Laura had 12 apples and 18 oranges. If Laura shared equal numbers of apples and oranges with her 6 friends, how many oranges did each friend take?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLaura has 12 apples and 18 oranges, and she shared these fruits equally among her 6 friends. To find out how many oranges each friend got, we first need to determine how many oranges are shared in total. Since Laura has 18 oranges and there are 6 friends, we need to divide 18 by 6. Performing the division: 18 ÷ 6 = 3. Thus, each friend received 3 oranges.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: Tom had 15 apples and 7 oranges. He ate 10 apples and 9 oranges.

Next, we calculate the difference in the quantity of oranges and apples he ate. To find this difference, we subtract the number of apples eaten from the number of oranges eaten: 9 oranges - 10 apples = -1. Since we are looking for how many more oranges than apples he ate, we note that he actually ate 1 less orange than he did apples. Thus, the answer is 1 less, which translates to saying there are no more oranges than apples eaten.\nTherefore, the answer is (1)\n\nQ: There were some apples in the basket. Michael picked 10 more apples from his tree and added them to the basket. Now there are 25 apples in the basket. How many apples were there in the basket at the beginning?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the initial number of apples in the basket be represented by 'x'. According to the problem, Michael picked 10 more apples from his tree and added them to the basket. After adding the apples, the total number of apples in the basket became 25. This can be represented by the equation: x + 10 = 25. To find the value of x, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: x = 25 - 10. Therefore, x = 15. This means there were initially 15 apples in the basket.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: Lila and her mom went apple picking. Lila's apples weighed 8 pounds. If together their apples weighed 22 pounds, how much more did her mom's apples weigh than hers?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know the weight of Lila's apples is 8 pounds. Next, we are given the total weight of both Lila's and her mom's apples, which is 22 pounds. To find the weight of her mom's apples, we subtract the weight of Lila's apples from the total weight: 22 pounds - 8 pounds = 14 pounds. Now we need to find out how much more her mom's apples weigh than Lila's. Since Lila's apples weigh 8 pounds and her mom's weigh 14 pounds, we subtract Lila's weight from her mom's weight: 14 pounds - 8 pounds = 6 pounds. Therefore, her mom's apples weigh 6 pounds more than Lila's apples.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: A farmer harvested 500 apples. He sold 120 of them and picked 60 new apples. How many more apples did the farmer sell than those he picked?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the farmer sold 120 apples. He then picked 60 new apples. To find out how many more apples he sold than those he picked, we can subtract the number of picked apples from the number of sold apples: 120 - 60. This will give us the difference in the number of apples sold and picked.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQ: Sarah shared the same amount of apples and bananas among her 6 classmates.

Next, we find out how many pets are hidden. We have 35 cats and 40 dogs hiding. To find the total number of hiding pets, we add the number of hidden cats and dogs: 35 + 40 = 75. Now, to get the number of pets that are not hiding, we subtract the number of hidden pets from the total number of pets: 90 - 75 = 15. Therefore, the number of pets that are not hiding is 15.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: A teacher had 5 students. After some left, she still had 6 students. How many more students stayed behind than those that left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe teacher originally had 5 students. After some left, she still had 6 students. This is a contradiction, as it is not possible to have more students remaining than there were initially if some have left. Therefore, it suggests that 1 student must have entered rather than indicating students left. Thus, it can be understood that 0 students left and 1 new student arrived. Since no students actually left, the number of students that stayed behind (5) is more than those that left (0). The difference is 5 - 0 = 5.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Lisa had 5 books on her desk. Later she added 3 more books to the desk and removed some of the old ones.

If 20 people are sitting, how many chairs are left without anyone sitting on them?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there are 15 folding chairs available. If 20 people are sitting, we first need to calculate how many chairs are being used. Since there are only 15 chairs and 20 people, it means that all 15 chairs will be occupied by the available 15 people, leaving 5 people without chairs. Therefore, the number of chairs that are left without anyone sitting on them is calculated by subtracting the number of chairs occupied from the total number of chairs available. Since all 15 chairs are occupied, the number of chairs left without anyone sitting on them is 0.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: A shopkeeper had 4 customers. After some walked out, he still had 5 customers. How many more customers remained than those who left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the shopkeeper had 4 customers. Some customers left, but after they left, he still had 5 customers remaining. This means that the number of customers remaining is greater than the number of customers he started with. To find out how many more customers remained than those who left, let's denote the number of customers that left as X. Initially, he had 4 customers, then after some left, he had 5 customers remaining. This means we can express this as: (initial customers) - (customers left) = (customers remaining), or 4 - X = 5. Solving for X, we get: 4 - 5 = X, which simplifies to X = -1. Since X represents the number of customers that left, it implies that 1 customer actually entered instead of leaving. Thus, instead of saying how many more remained than left, it should be considered that there was 1 customer more than initially present who remained. Therefore, the additional customer contributing to a surplus remains as 1. Hence, the difference is 1 more customer remained than those who left.\nTherefore, the answer is (1)\n\nQuestion: A waiter had 3 customers. After some left he still had 4 customers.

However, we don't have daily visitor numbers for the entire 35 days, so we need to make an assumption. One method is to assume a consistent average based on the last few known days. We have 623 visitors on the latest day and 170 on the day before that. Adding these two gives us a total of 793 visitors over a 2-day span. This means, on average, there were 793 / 2 = 396.5 visitors per day for those two days. Assuming this average holds over 35 days: 396.5 visitors/day * 35 days = 13,927.5 visitors in total. Since the number of visitors must be rounded to whole numbers, we round down to 13,927. Thus, the total number of visitors over this period can be approximated by this average calculation.\nTherefore, the answer is (13927)\n\nQ: After savoring a light meal, they took a trip to visit the Vatican Museums. There were 60 frescoes in the Vatican Museums. There, Alex realized that 499 visitors came to the Vatican Museums that day. If there were 125 visitors the day before. How many visited the Vatican Museums within 40 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total number of visitors to the Vatican Museums over 40 days, we first need to understand the visitor patterns given in the problem. The scenario indicates that there were 499 visitors on one specific day mentioned. It's also noted that there were 125 visitors the day before. However, we are not given a direct pattern for the number of visitors for each of the 40 days. Assuming that the visitor numbers remain constant, we can take the average from the two provided days. The average number of visitors between the two days is (499 + 125) / 2 = 312. Therefore, if we assume this average holds for all 40 days, we can multiply the average by the number of days to find the total: 312 visitors/day * 40 days = 12480 visitors in total. Hence, the calculations lead us to conclude that the number of visitors over 40 days is 12480 visitors.\nTherefore, the answer is (12480)\n\nQ: After enjoying a delightful breakfast, they decided to visit the Tower of London. There, Sarah discovered that 150 tourists had visited the Tower the day before. If there were 800 visitors on that day, how many more visitors came to the Tower that day than the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many more visitors came to the Tower on the day in question compared to the previous day, we start with the number of visitors on that day, which is 800. Next, we note the number of visitors from the previous day, which is 150. To find the difference, we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day: 800 - 150 = 650. Therefore, the number of additional visitors on that day compared to the previous day is 650.\nTherefore, the answer is (650)\n\nQ: After enjoying a thrilling experience at a theme park, they stopped by the London Zoo. There, Brian realized that 200 visitors had gone to the Zoo the previous day. If the total for that day was 1000 visitors, how many more visited the Zoo on that day than the day before?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more visitors went to the Zoo on the current day compared to the previous day, we first need to know the number of visitors that came on the current day. The problem states that there were a total of 1000 visitors on the current day and that there were 200 visitors on the previous day. To find the difference in the number of visitors, we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the current day's visitors. Therefore, we calculate: 1000 (current day visitors) - 200 (previous day visitors) = 800. Thus, 800 more visitors went to the Zoo on the current day than the day before.\nTherefore, the answer is (800)\n\nQ: After a filling brunch, they went to check out the Colosseum. There were 200 arches in the Colosseum. There, Lisa noticed that 912 visitors came to the Colosseum that day. If there were 190 visitors on the previous day. How many visited the Colosseum within 50 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many visitors came to the Colosseum within 50 days, we first need to determine the daily number of visitors. On the first day, there were 912 visitors. The previous day had 190 visitors. Assuming a constant daily increase in visitors, we can calculate the total visitors over the next 50 days. The daily visitor count appears to follow a pattern, starting with 912 and increasing based on the previous day's count, but for simplicity, we can estimate an average of visitors based on the two known counts which are 912 and 190. For the sake of calculation, we can take the midpoint (average) of these two figures to estimate daily visitors: (912 + 190)/2 = 551. Therefore, if we consider an average of 551 visitors per day over the span of 50 days, we multiply 551 by 50 to find the total number of visitors: 551 * 50 = 27550. Hence, over the span of 50 days, the projected total visitor count is 27550.\nTherefore, the answer is (27550)\n\nQ: After enjoying a big breakfast, they went to explore the Eiffel Tower. There were 50 elevators in the Eiffel Tower. There, Sarah discovered that 780 visitors came to the Eiffel Tower that day. If there were 300 visitors the previous day. How many visited the Eiffel Tower within 30 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors to the Eiffel Tower within 30 days, we need to establish the daily visitor trend. Given that on one particular day there were 780 visitors and the previous day there were 300 visitors, we can calculate an average or assume these numbers represent the start of a pattern. However, without additional data for the other days, we can only calculate the total based on these figures. If we take 780 visitors as a representation for the number of visitors for one day and assume that this figure stays consistent for 30 days, then the total can be calculated by multiplying the daily visitors by the number of days. Hence, the total number of visitors would be: 780 visitors/day * 30 days = 23400 visitors over 30 days. We will assume that no significant fluctuation in daily visitors occurs during those 30 days for this calculation.\nTherefore, the answer is (23400)\n\nQ: After finishing their lunch, they decided to visit the Louvre Museum. There were 120 sculptures in the Louvre Museum. There, Mark found out that 346 visitors came to the Louvre Museum that day. If there were 210 visitors the day before. How many visited the Louvre Museum within 45 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that on the day described, 346 visitors came to the Louvre Museum. The day before, there were 210 visitors. To find the total number of visitors over 45 days, we need to calculate the average number of visitors per day based on the data we have and then multiply that by 45 days. However, we only have the visitor numbers for two specific days. Assuming the number of visitors could fluctuate and using the provided numbers, we can average them. The average for the two days is (346 + 210) / 2 = 278 visitors per day. This allows us to estimate total visitors over 45 days: 278 visitors/day * 45 days = 12,510 visitors. Therefore, the answer is (12510).\nTherefore, the answer is (12510)\n\nQ: After a satisfying meal, they ventured to admire the Taj Mahal. There were 1000 workers involved in building the Taj Mahal. There, Ava found out that 654 visitors visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 220 visitors the previous day. How many visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors who visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days, we first note the visitor counts for the specific days mentioned. For the current day, 654 visitors were recorded. For the previous day, there were 220 visitors. Assuming that these two days are part of the 70-day period, we need to estimate the average number of visitors over these 70 days. If we take both these days into account, we would have 654 + 220 = 874 visitors over these two days. This gives us an average of 874 visitors / 2 days = 437 visitors per day for these two days. To find the estimated total visitors over 70 days, we can multiply the average daily count by the total number of days: 437 visitors/day * 70 days = 30,590 visitors. We can assume that the visitor numbers remain relatively consistent each day of the period being analyzed. Therefore, the estimated total number of visitors to the Taj Mahal within 70 days is around 30,590.\nTherefore, the answer is (30590)\n\nQuestion: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace.

{"prompt": "Q: There were 6 tulips in the vase. Anna took out 3 tulips from the vase and selected some fresh tulips from her garden to add to the vase. There are now 16 tulips in the vase. How many tulips did she select?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 6 tulips in the vase. After Anna took out 3 tulips, the total number of tulips left in the vase became 6 - 3 = 3 tulips. We know that after adding some fresh tulips from her garden, the total number of tulips in the vase is now 16. To find out how many tulips Anna added from her garden, we can set up the equation: 3 (the number of tulips left) + x (the number of tulips added) = 16. Solving for x gives us: x = 16 - 3 = 13. Hence, Anna selected 13 tulips from her garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (13)\n\nQ: Maria had 7 plants in her garden. Later she added 5 more plants to the garden and removed some of the old ones. If there are 9 plants in her garden now, how many plants did she remove from the garden?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMaria initially had 7 plants. She then added 5 more plants, making the total number of plants 7 + 5 = 12. Now, there are only 9 plants left in the garden. To find out how many plants she removed, we subtract the current number of plants from the total number she had after the addition: 12 - 9 = 3. Therefore, Maria removed 3 plants from her garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: There were 3 sunflowers in the jar. Emma removed 2 sunflowers from the jar and cut some more sunflowers from her garden to arrange in the jar. There are now 12 sunflowers in the jar. How many sunflowers did she cut?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 3 sunflowers in the jar. Emma removed 2 sunflowers from the jar, leaving her with 3 - 2 = 1 sunflower in the jar. After cutting more sunflowers from her garden, the total number of sunflowers in the jar increased to 12 sunflowers. To find out how many she cut, we can set up the equation: 1 (remaining sunflower) + x (number of sunflowers cut) = 12. Solving for x gives us 12 - 1 = 11. Therefore, Emma cut 11 sunflowers from her garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (11)\n\nQ: There were 40 ivy vines and 80 rose bushes in the backyard. Claire trimmed some more ivy vines and rose bushes. Now there are 45 ivy vines and 85 rose bushes in the backyard. How many ivy vines did she trim?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 40 ivy vines. After Claire trimmed some, the number of ivy vines increased to 45. However, this indicates that instead of trimming, the number of ivy vines actually increased by 5. This means Claire must have added vines instead of trimming them. Therefore, the number of ivy vines trimmed is 0 because the count increased.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: There were 5 geraniums in the pot. Olivia snipped some more geraniums from her garden which had a total of 10 geraniums. There are now 15 geraniums in the pot. How many geraniums are left in the garden?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 5 geraniums in the pot. Olivia snipped some geraniums from her garden, which had a total of 10 geraniums. After snipping, the total number of geraniums in the pot became 15. Thus, the number of geraniums Olivia snipped from her garden is calculated by the equation: 5 (initial in pot) + x (snipped) = 15 (total in pot). Solving for x gives: x = 15 - 5 = 10. Therefore, Olivia snipped 10 geraniums from her garden. Since she started with 10 geraniums in her garden and snipped all of them, the number of geraniums left in the garden is 10 - 10 = 0.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: There were 6 orchids and 4 tulips in the planter. Anna picked some more orchids and tulips from her garden. Now there are 9 orchids and 3 tulips in the planter. How many more orchids than tulips are there in the planter now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 6 orchids and 4 tulips in the planter. After Anna picked more flowers, the number of orchids increased to 9 and the number of tulips decreased to 3. To find out how many more orchids than tulips there are now, we subtract the number of tulips from the number of orchids: 9 orchids - 3 tulips = 6. Therefore, there are 6 more orchids than tulips in the planter.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: There were 11 orchids in the display. Sarah arranged some more orchids from her collection which had a total of 9 orchids. There are now 20 orchids in the display. How many orchids are left in the collection?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 11 orchids in the display. Sarah then arranged some more orchids from her collection, which totaled 9 orchids. After adding these orchids, the total number of orchids in the display increased to 20. To find out how many orchids Sarah used from her collection, we subtract the initial number of orchids from the final total: 20 - 11 = 9. This means all 9 orchids from her collection were used to reach the total of 20 in the display. Since Sarah's initial collection had 9 orchids and all were used, the number of orchids left in the collection is 9 - 9 = 0.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: There were 4 orchids in the pot. David threw away 5 orchids from the pot and picked some new orchids from his greenhouse to place in the pot. There are now 14 orchids in the pot. How many orchids did he pick?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 4 orchids in the pot. David threw away 5 orchids, which means now there would be -1 orchids (4 - 5 = -1). Since you cannot have a negative number of orchids, we interpret this as starting from 0 orchids after throwing them away. David then picked some new orchids, and the total in the pot became 14. Therefore, the number of orchids David picked can be calculated as: 14 (total now) - 0 (remaining orchids after throwing away) = 14. Hence, the number of new orchids he picked is 14.\nTherefore, the answer is (14)\n\nQuestion: There were 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase.

{"prompt": "Q: Michael picked some apples from his orchard to place in his basket. There are now 25 apples in the basket. If there were 7 apples in the basket initially. How many apples did he pick?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 7 apples in the basket. Michael then added more apples, bringing the total to 25 apples. To find how many apples he picked, we subtract the initial number of apples from the final total: 25 apples - 7 apples = 18 apples. Therefore, the number of apples Michael picked is 18.\nTherefore, the answer is (18)\n\nQ: Emily has 25 pear trees. She picked 2 pears from one of her trees. Now the tree has 8 pears still on it. How many pears did the tree have to begin with?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pears the tree had to begin with, we start by considering the current state of the tree. After Emily picked 2 pears, the tree has 8 pears remaining. Therefore, we can set up the equation: initial pears - 2 = remaining pears, where the remaining pears is 8. Thus, we have: initial pears - 2 = 8. To isolate the initial pears, we add 2 to both sides of the equation: initial pears = 8 + 2. Therefore, the initial number of pears the tree had is 10.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: There were some apples in the basket. Michael picked 10 more apples from his tree and added them to the basket. Now there are 25 apples in the basket. How many apples were there in the basket at the beginning?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the initial number of apples in the basket be represented by 'x'. According to the problem, Michael picked 10 more apples from his tree and added them to the basket. After adding the apples, the total number of apples in the basket became 25. This can be represented by the equation: x + 10 = 25. To find the value of x, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: x = 25 - 10. Therefore, x = 15. This means there were initially 15 apples in the basket.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: Sarah shared the same amount of apples and bananas among her 6 classmates. If she had 48 apples and 84 bananas to start with, how many apples did each classmate get?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many apples Sarah can distribute among her 6 classmates. She starts with a total of 48 apples. To find out how many apples each classmate gets, we divide the total number of apples by the number of classmates. This gives us: 48 apples ÷ 6 classmates = 8 apples per classmate. Therefore, each classmate receives 8 apples.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: Being her favorite, she finished checking on the apple orchards after 45 visits. She was informed by 200 of the workers that they harvest 120 baskets of apples each day. How many baskets of apples would be harvested in 60 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many baskets of apples will be harvested in 60 days, we first need to find out how many baskets are harvested in one day. According to the information provided, 200 workers harvest 120 baskets of apples each day. Therefore, the daily harvest is 120 baskets. Now, to find the total baskets harvested over 60 days, we simply multiply the daily harvest by the number of days: 120 baskets/day * 60 days = 7200 baskets. Thus, the total number of baskets harvested in 60 days is 7200.\nTherefore, the answer is (7200)\n\nQ: A farmer harvested 500 apples. He sold 120 of them and picked 60 new apples. How many more apples did the farmer sell than those he picked?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, the farmer sold 120 apples. He then picked 60 new apples. To find out how many more apples he sold than those he picked, we can subtract the number of picked apples from the number of sold apples: 120 - 60. This will give us the difference in the number of apples sold and picked.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQ: Emma has 4 pear trees. She picked 9 pears from each of the trees. Now, there are 20 pears left on the trees. How many pears did Emma pick in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nEmma has 4 pear trees and she picked 9 pears from each tree. To find out how many pears Emma picked in total, we can calculate the total pears she picked from all trees. This can be done by multiplying the number of pears picked from each tree by the total number of trees: 9 pears/tree * 4 trees = 36 pears. Now, we can also verify this by understanding that there were originally pears on the trees before Emma picked them. Let 'x' be the total number of pears before picking. After picking, there were 20 pears left, so we have: x - 36 = 20. Solving for x gives us x = 20 + 36 = 56. Emma has indeed picked a total of 36 pears, which confirms our earlier calculation.\nTherefore, the answer is (36)\n\nQ: Maria had 15 apples. She ate 10 apples and gave 5 of them to her neighbor. How many more apples did she give to her neighbor than those she ate?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMaria initially had 15 apples. After eating 10 apples, she had 5 apples left. She then gave away 5 apples to her neighbor. The number of apples she ate is 10, while the number of apples she gave to her neighbor is 5. To find out how many more apples she gave to her neighbor than she ate, we calculate: 5 (apples given) - 10 (apples eaten) = -5. This means she gave 5 apples less to her neighbor than she ate.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (-5).)\n\nQuestion: Rachel's tree had 4 apples. She picked 2 apples from her tree.

{"prompt": "Q: Daniel gets $26 weekly during his 1150 weeks of service. He also earns $1,150 each week for overtime work. If he works overtime every week, what is his total earning for those weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate Daniel's weekly earnings from regular work, which is $26 per week. Over 1150 weeks, the total from regular work would be 26 * 1150 = 29900 dollars. Next, we calculate his overtime earnings, which is $1150 each week. Over 1150 weeks, the total from overtime would be 1150 * 1150 = 1322500 dollars. Now, we add both totals to get his overall earnings: 29900 + 1322500 = 1352400 dollars. Therefore, the total earnings for those weeks is 1352400 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (1352400)\n\nQ: Jordan is paid $30 weekly during 1100 weeks of service. He also earns $1,000 per week for overtime. If he puts in overtime every week, what is his total income during this timeframe?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate Jordan's total income during 1100 weeks, we need to consider both his regular pay and his overtime pay. First, we calculate his regular income:\n1. Jordan is paid $30 weekly for regular hours.\n2. For 1100 weeks, his regular income is:\n   30 * 1100 = 33,000. \n\nNext, we calculate his overtime income:\n3. Jordan earns $1,000 per week for overtime.\n4. For 1100 weeks, his overtime income is:\n   1000 * 1100 = 1,100,000.\n\nNow, we add both incomes together to find his total income:\n5. Total income = Regular income + Overtime income = 33,000 + 1,100,000 = 1,133,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (1133000).\nTherefore, the answer is (1133000)\n\nQ: Sofia earns $35 each week for 950 weeks of labor. On top of that, she gets $920 weekly for overtime work. If she works overtime every week, how much does she make in total during this labor period?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate Sofia's weekly earnings without overtime: $35 per week for 950 weeks. Next, calculate her total earnings from this labor: 35 * 950 = $33,250. Now, calculate her weekly earnings from overtime: $920 per week for 950 weeks. This totals: 920 * 950 = $874,000. Finally, add her regular earnings and her overtime earnings together: $33,250 + $874,000 = $907,250. Therefore, the total amount she makes during this labor period is $907,250.\nTherefore, the answer is (907250)\n\nQ: The Book Nook bookstore profits $25 for each book sold. During the summer sale and winter sale, they sold a total of 200 books. They sold 150 books during the summer sale. How much money did they generate from selling the books during the winter sale?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine how many books were sold during the winter sale. Since a total of 200 books were sold during both sales and 150 were sold in the summer sale, we subtract the summer sales from the total sales: 200 - 150 = 50 books sold in the winter sale. Next, we calculate the profit generated from these 50 books. The profit per book sold is $25, so we multiply the number of winter sale books by the profit per book: 50 books * $25/book = $1250. Therefore, the total money generated from selling the books during the winter sale is $1250.\nTherefore, the answer is (1250)\n\nQ: The Ice Cream Parlor makes $5 for each scoop sold. During the summer season and winter season, they sold a total of 500 scoops. They sold 320 scoops during the summer season. How much money did they earn from selling the scoops during the winter season?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know the total number of scoops sold is 500. Out of these, 320 scoops were sold during the summer. To find the number of scoops sold during the winter, we subtract the summer scoops from the total: 500 - 320 = 180. Next, we know that each scoop sold earns the parlor $5. Therefore, the earnings from the winter season would be calculated by multiplying the number of winter scoops by the price per scoop: 180 scoops * $5 = $900.\nTherefore, the answer is (900)\n\nQ: David has a weekly income of $27 for 1085 weeks of employment. Furthermore, he earns $1,050 for every week he works overtime. If he puts in overtime every week, what is his total earnings during his employment?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nDavid earns a weekly income of $27 for 1085 weeks. To calculate his total earnings from his regular income, we multiply his weekly income by the total number of weeks: 27 * 1085. Additionally, David earns $1,050 for every week he works overtime, and since he puts in overtime every week for the same number of weeks, this adds another income stream. Thus, we calculate the overtime earnings by multiplying $1,050 by the total number of weeks: 1,050 * 1085. Finally, we sum both the regular earnings and the overtime earnings to find the total earnings during his employment.\nTherefore, the answer is (1162350)\n\nQ: Olivia makes $40 weekly during her 1005 weeks of work. She additionally earns $1,200 each week for her overtime. If she always works overtime, how much then does she earn for the entire work period?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate Olivia's regular weekly earnings which is $40. Over 1005 weeks, her total earnings from regular hours is 40 * 1005. Next, we calculate her overtime weekly earnings of $1200. Over the same 1005 weeks, her total earnings from overtime is 1200 * 1005. Finally, we add the two totals together to find her total earnings for the entire work period.\nTherefore, the answer is (1242000)\n\nQ: Ben receives $32 weekly during his 1120 weeks of harvest. He also makes $980 per week for overtime hours. If he works overtime every week, how much does he earn during the harvest season?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate Ben's total earnings during the harvest season, we first need to calculate his weekly earnings from both regular work and overtime. Ben receives $32 weekly from his harvest work and also earns $980 per week from overtime. Hence, his total weekly earnings can be calculated by adding these two amounts together: $32 + $980 = $1012. Now, since he works for 1120 weeks during the harvest, we can calculate his total earnings by multiplying his total weekly earnings by the number of weeks: $1012 * 1120 weeks = $1,134,640. Therefore, his earnings during the harvest season amount to $1,134,640.\nTherefore, the answer is (1134640)\n\nQuestion: Lewis earns $ 28 every week during the 1091 weeks of harvest.

{"prompt": "Q: 42 runners entered a marathon and 9 runners joined a training session in the morning. 24 runners entered the marathon in the afternoon. How many runners participated in both the marathon and training session altogether?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many runners participated in both the marathon and the training session, we need to look at the information provided. There were 42 runners who entered the marathon, and among these, 9 runners participated in a training session in the morning. Additionally, 24 more runners joined the marathon in the afternoon. The important aspect to note is that the 9 runners who did the training session are part of the 42 runners in the marathon. Therefore, they are counted as participants in both events. The question asks for the total number of runners who participated in both events, which are simply the 9 runners who trained in the morning. The 24 runners who entered in the afternoon did not affect the count of those who trained, as the training participants were already part of the total marathon runners. Hence, only the 9 runners from training are counted for both. Thus, the final answer is 9.\nTherefore, the answer is (9)\n\nQ: 48 players joined a running club and 7 players went to a fitness class in the morning. 27 players joined the running club in the afternoon. How many players participated in both activities in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of unique players who participated in either or both activities. There are 48 players in the running club and 27 players joined in the afternoon. The 7 players who went to the fitness class in the morning are part of the running club. Given that we don't have information about overlaps between the morning fitness class and the afternoon running participation, we can only assume the worst-case scenario where the morning participants might not include any of the afternoon new joiners. Therefore, the unique total goes as follows: We have 48 players in the running club + 27 afternoon joiners - 7 who participated in both (if these are the same individuals). Thus, the equation becomes 48 + 27 - 7 = 68. To find the total who participated in both activities explicitly, we simply return to identify how many of the morning's 7 players are among the 27 afternoon joiners. As we lack clear overlapping data, we conclude with total simply as distinct aggregates.\nTherefore, the answer is (68)\n\nQ: In a park, there were ducks and rabbits. The total number of animals in the park was 65. If 30 ducks and 28 rabbits were hiding, how many animals were not hiding in all?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the total number of animals in the park, which is 65. Out of these, 30 ducks are hiding and 28 rabbits are hiding. To find out how many animals are hiding in total, we add the number of hiding ducks and hiding rabbits. So, we have 30 + 28 = 58 animals hiding. Next, we need to find out how many animals are not hiding. We subtract the total number of hiding animals from the total number of animals in the park: 65 - 58 = 7. Therefore, the number of animals that are not hiding is 7.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: The train ride in adventure land has a series of carriages. Each carriage accommodates 10 passengers. If 70 passengers can board the train simultaneously, how many carriages are there?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the number of carriages needed to accommodate 70 passengers, we start by knowing that each carriage can hold 10 passengers. We can calculate the number of carriages by dividing the total number of passengers by the capacity of each carriage. Thus, we perform the calculation: 70 passengers / 10 passengers per carriage = 7 carriages. Therefore, the train requires 7 carriages to hold all 70 passengers simultaneously.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: The zoo is planning a special event. The zoo has 5 animal exhibits. There are 30 visitors attending the event and 2 tour guides. If each tour guide leads an equal number of visitors, how many visitors are in each group?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many visitors each tour guide will lead, we need to divide the total number of visitors by the number of tour guides. There are 30 visitors and 2 tour guides. Therefore, we calculate: 30 visitors / 2 tour guides = 15 visitors per tour guide.\nTherefore, the answer is (15)\n\nQ: Rainy season is here, and numerous frogs are heading to the wetlands. There were 34 frog families in the pond. If 5 frog families hopped away for the rainy season, how many more frog families remained than those that hopped away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there are 34 frog families in the pond. Out of these, 5 frog families hopped away for the rainy season. To find out how many frog families remained in the pond, we subtract the number of families that hopped away from the initial number of families: 34 - 5 = 29. Next, we want to find how many more families remained than those that hopped away. Since 5 frog families hopped away, the difference between the number of families that remained and those that hopped away is: 29 (remaining) - 5 (hopped away) = 24. Thus, there are 24 more frog families remaining than those that hopped away.\nTherefore, the answer is (24)\n\nQ: The scouts are preparing for a camping trip. The scouts have 40 participants. There are 15 tents available for the trip. If 5 participants are not going, how many scouts will be on the camping trip?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many scouts will be on the camping trip, we start with the total number of participants, which is 40. We are informed that 5 participants are not going on the trip. Therefore, we subtract the number of participants not going from the total number of participants: 40 - 5 = 35. Thus, 35 scouts will be on the camping trip.\nTherefore, the answer is (35)\n\nQ: Sarah helped her brother set up tents and together they erected 24 tents. They put up 8 tents in each camping area and only 32 tents were available in each area. How many camping areas did they manage?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe know that Sarah and her brother set up a total of 24 tents and they put up 8 tents in each camping area. To find out how many camping areas they managed, we need to divide the total number of tents by the number of tents they set up in each area. The calculation would be 24 tents divided by 8 tents per area, which gives us 3 camping areas. Therefore, the number of camping areas they managed is 3.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQuestion: 41 campers went rowing and 4 campers went hiking in the morning. 26 campers went rowing in the afternoon.

If the bread recipe requires a total of 500 g of flour. How many grams of flour does she already have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much flour she already has, we can use the total amount of flour required for the recipe and subtract the amount of flour she still needs. The recipe requires 500 g of flour and she needs an additional 125 g. So, we subtract 125 g from 500 g: 500 g - 125 g = 375 g. Therefore, she already has 375 g of flour.\nTherefore, the answer is (375)\n\nQ: Alex is baking cookies. The recipe calls for 8 cups of chocolate chips and 5 cups of sugar. He has already used 6 cups of chocolate chips. How many more cups of sugar than cups of chocolate chips does he need to add now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe recipe requires a total of 8 cups of chocolate chips and 5 cups of sugar. Alex has already used 6 cups of chocolate chips, so he still needs to add 2 cups of chocolate chips (8 - 6 = 2). The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar, and since he has not mentioned using any sugar yet, he needs to add all 5 cups of sugar. Now, to find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of chocolate chips he needs to add, we calculate the difference between the cups of sugar needed (5) and the cups of chocolate chips he still needs to add (2). Therefore, 5 - 2 = 3. Alex needs to add 3 more cups of sugar than cups of chocolate chips.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: Lisa bakes cookies.

According to the problem, Lisa burnt 30 cookies and baked 25 cookies perfectly. Next, we find the difference between the number of burnt cookies and the perfectly baked cookies: 30 (burnt) - 25 (perfectly baked) = 5. Thus, Lisa burned 5 more cookies than those she baked perfectly.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Tom is making pancakes. The recipe requires 4 cups of milk and 2 cups of flour. He has already poured in 3 cups of milk. How many more cups of flour than cups of milk does he need to add now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTom's pancake recipe requires 4 cups of milk and 2 cups of flour. He has already added 3 cups of milk. To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of milk he needs to add, we first determine how much more milk is needed. Since the recipe calls for 4 cups, he needs 4 - 3 = 1 cup more of milk. The recipe calls for 2 cups of flour. Since he has not yet added any flour, he still needs to add the full 2 cups. Now we compare how many more cups of flour he needs to add compared to the cups of milk he needs to add. He has 1 cup more of milk to add and needs to add 2 cups of flour, therefore he is adding 2 - 1 = 1 cup more of flour than milk at this point.\nTherefore, the answer is (1)\n\nQ: Sara is making a salad. The recipe asks for 2 cups of lettuce and 6 cups of tomatoes. She has already added some lettuce. If she still needs 1 more cup of lettuce than tomatoes, how many more cups of lettuce does she need to add?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet's denote the amount of lettuce Sara has added as L and the amount of tomatoes as T. According to the recipe, she needs a total of 2 cups of lettuce and 6 cups of tomatoes. The problem states that she still needs 1 more cup of lettuce than tomatoes, meaning if we denote the amount of lettuce she still needs as x, then: x = T + 1. We know T is the total amount of tomatoes she needs, which is 6 cups. Thus, we have: x = 6 + 1 = 7 cups of lettuce that she needs in total. So the total amount of lettuce she needs is 7 cups. She has already added some lettuce, which is L cups. We want to find out how many more cups of lettuce she needs to add: Additional lettuce needed = Total lettuce needed - Already added lettuce = 7 - L. However, the actual value of L is not provided. We only know she needs more lettuce than the total of T by 1 cup. Therefore, if she needs to add 1 more cup than the amount of tomatoes, she needs to add enough lettuce to reach that target of 7 cups in total, which leads us to conclude that she needs 1 cup more than the 6 cups of tomatoes she has. Thus, she needs to add additional lettuce but the amount already added needs to be subtracted from the total amount she needs, which is dependent on how much she has already added.\nTherefore, the answer is (The problem does not provide the current amount of lettuce she has added, so we cannot determine how many more cups of lettuce she needs without that information.)\n\nQ: David is preparing cookies. The recipe calls for 5 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar. He has already included 2 cups of flour and 1 cup of sugar. How many more cups of flour does he need to add?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe recipe calls for a total of 5 cups of flour. David has already added 2 cups of flour. To find out how much more flour he needs to add, we subtract the amount of flour he has already added from the total amount required: 5 cups (total) - 2 cups (already added) = 3 cups. Therefore, David needs to add 3 more cups of flour.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: Sophie is making pancakes. The recipe needs 3 cups of flour, 2 cups of milk, and 1 cup of sugar. She has already added 1 cup of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSophie needs a total of 3 cups of flour for the recipe. She has already added 1 cup of flour, so she needs to add 3 - 1 = 2 more cups of flour. The recipe also requires 1 cup of sugar. We need to find out how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar she needs to add. She needs to add 2 cups of flour and 0 cups of sugar, since she already has all the required sugar. Therefore, she needs to add 2 - 0 = 2 more cups of flour than cups of sugar.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQuestion: Mary is baking a cake.

{"prompt": "Q: Maria had 7 plants in her garden. Later she added 5 more plants to the garden and removed some of the old ones. If there are 9 plants in her garden now, how many plants did she remove from the garden?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMaria initially had 7 plants. She then added 5 more plants, making the total number of plants 7 + 5 = 12. Now, there are only 9 plants left in the garden. To find out how many plants she removed, we subtract the current number of plants from the total number she had after the addition: 12 - 9 = 3. Therefore, Maria removed 3 plants from her garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: There were 11 orchids in the display. Sarah arranged some more orchids from her collection which had a total of 9 orchids. There are now 20 orchids in the display. How many orchids are left in the collection?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 11 orchids in the display. Sarah then arranged some more orchids from her collection, which totaled 9 orchids. After adding these orchids, the total number of orchids in the display increased to 20. To find out how many orchids Sarah used from her collection, we subtract the initial number of orchids from the final total: 20 - 11 = 9. This means all 9 orchids from her collection were used to reach the total of 20 in the display. Since Sarah's initial collection had 9 orchids and all were used, the number of orchids left in the collection is 9 - 9 = 0.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: There were 4 peonies in the vase. Laura cut some more peonies from her garden which had a total of 25 peonies. There are now 12 peonies in the vase. How many peonies did she cut?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 4 peonies in the vase. After Laura cut more peonies from her garden, the total number of peonies in the vase increased to 12. To find out how many peonies Laura cut, we can subtract the initial number of peonies in the vase from the final number of peonies in the vase: 12 - 4 = 8. Therefore, Laura cut a total of 8 peonies.\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: There were 3 sunflowers in the jar. Emma removed 2 sunflowers from the jar and cut some more sunflowers from her garden to arrange in the jar. There are now 12 sunflowers in the jar. How many sunflowers did she cut?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 3 sunflowers in the jar. Emma removed 2 sunflowers from the jar, leaving her with 3 - 2 = 1 sunflower in the jar. After cutting more sunflowers from her garden, the total number of sunflowers in the jar increased to 12 sunflowers. To find out how many she cut, we can set up the equation: 1 (remaining sunflower) + x (number of sunflowers cut) = 12. Solving for x gives us 12 - 1 = 11. Therefore, Emma cut 11 sunflowers from her garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (11)\n\nQ: There were 6 tulips in the vase. Anna took out 3 tulips from the vase and selected some fresh tulips from her garden to add to the vase. There are now 16 tulips in the vase. How many tulips did she select?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 6 tulips in the vase. After Anna took out 3 tulips, the total number of tulips left in the vase became 6 - 3 = 3 tulips. We know that after adding some fresh tulips from her garden, the total number of tulips in the vase is now 16. To find out how many tulips Anna added from her garden, we can set up the equation: 3 (the number of tulips left) + x (the number of tulips added) = 16. Solving for x gives us: x = 16 - 3 = 13. Hence, Anna selected 13 tulips from her garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (13)\n\nQ: There were 6 orchids and 4 tulips in the planter. Anna picked some more orchids and tulips from her garden. Now there are 9 orchids and 3 tulips in the planter.

After Anna picked more flowers, the number of orchids increased to 9 and the number of tulips decreased to 3. To find out how many more orchids than tulips there are now, we subtract the number of tulips from the number of orchids: 9 orchids - 3 tulips = 6. Therefore, there are 6 more orchids than tulips in the planter.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: There were 4 orchids in the pot. David threw away 5 orchids from the pot and picked some new orchids from his greenhouse to place in the pot. There are now 14 orchids in the pot. How many orchids did he pick?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 4 orchids in the pot. David threw away 5 orchids, which means now there would be -1 orchids (4 - 5 = -1). Since you cannot have a negative number of orchids, we interpret this as starting from 0 orchids after throwing them away. David then picked some new orchids, and the total in the pot became 14. Therefore, the number of orchids David picked can be calculated as: 14 (total now) - 0 (remaining orchids after throwing away) = 14. Hence, the number of new orchids he picked is 14.\nTherefore, the answer is (14)\n\nQ: There were 6 orchids in the display.

{"prompt": "Q: After indulging in a delightful snack, they went to visit the Tower of London. There were 30 crowns in the Tower of London. There, Emily learned that 623 visitors came to the Tower of London that day. If there were 170 visitors the day before. How many visited the Tower of London within 35 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the total number of visitors to the Tower of London over 35 days, we start with the information given. We know that on the most recent day there were 623 visitors. The day before, there were 170 visitors. However, we don't have daily visitor numbers for the entire 35 days, so we need to make an assumption. One method is to assume a consistent average based on the last few known days. We have 623 visitors on the latest day and 170 on the day before that. Adding these two gives us a total of 793 visitors over a 2-day span. This means, on average, there were 793 / 2 = 396.5 visitors per day for those two days. Assuming this average holds over 35 days: 396.5 visitors/day * 35 days = 13,927.5 visitors in total. Since the number of visitors must be rounded to whole numbers, we round down to 13,927. Thus, the total number of visitors over this period can be approximated by this average calculation.\nTherefore, the answer is (13927)\n\nQ: After savoring a delightful dinner, they ventured to the Louvre Museum. There, Alex noted that 250 art lovers visited the Louvre that day. If 730 visitors explored the Louvre in the last 300 days, how many guests were there the day prior?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the number of guests that visited the Louvre the day prior, we first need to calculate the average number of visitors over the 300 days. We know that there were 730 visitors in total over these 300 days. Therefore, we can calculate the average as follows: Average visitors = Total visitors / Number of days = 730 / 300. This gives us an average of approximately 2.43 visitors per day. Since we know that there were 250 visitors on the current day, we can find the number of visitors the day prior by using the average: Total visitors in 300 days = Previous day visitors + Current day visitors + Other previous days visitors. If we assume that the number of visitors fluctuates, it would be reasonable to conclude that the day prior had fewer visitors than today, adjusting the average might show that the previous day had around this average visitor count. But, the exact visitor number cannot be calculated with the given data without making assumptions about the distribution of visitors. Hence, we cannot determine the exact number of visitors the previous day based solely on the provided information.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (unknown).)\n\nQ: After finishing their lunch, they decided to visit the Louvre Museum. There were 120 sculptures in the Louvre Museum. There, Mark found out that 346 visitors came to the Louvre Museum that day. If there were 210 visitors the day before. How many visited the Louvre Museum within 45 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that on the day described, 346 visitors came to the Louvre Museum. The day before, there were 210 visitors. To find the total number of visitors over 45 days, we need to calculate the average number of visitors per day based on the data we have and then multiply that by 45 days. However, we only have the visitor numbers for two specific days. Assuming the number of visitors could fluctuate and using the provided numbers, we can average them. The average for the two days is (346 + 210) / 2 = 278 visitors per day. This allows us to estimate total visitors over 45 days: 278 visitors/day * 45 days = 12,510 visitors. Therefore, the answer is (12510).\nTherefore, the answer is (12510)\n\nQ: After enjoying a big breakfast, they went to explore the Eiffel Tower. There were 50 elevators in the Eiffel Tower. There, Sarah discovered that 780 visitors came to the Eiffel Tower that day. If there were 300 visitors the previous day. How many visited the Eiffel Tower within 30 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors to the Eiffel Tower within 30 days, we need to establish the daily visitor trend. Given that on one particular day there were 780 visitors and the previous day there were 300 visitors, we can calculate an average or assume these numbers represent the start of a pattern. However, without additional data for the other days, we can only calculate the total based on these figures. If we take 780 visitors as a representation for the number of visitors for one day and assume that this figure stays consistent for 30 days, then the total can be calculated by multiplying the daily visitors by the number of days. Hence, the total number of visitors would be: 780 visitors/day * 30 days = 23400 visitors over 30 days. We will assume that no significant fluctuation in daily visitors occurs during those 30 days for this calculation.\nTherefore, the answer is (23400)\n\nQ: After finishing a fabulous brunch, they decided to tour the Palace of Versailles. There, Emily discovered that 180 guests visited the Palace that day. If 600 visitors had toured the Palace in the past 100 days, how many came the day before?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many visitors came the day before, we first need to determine the average number of visitors per day over the past 100 days. We can calculate the average by dividing the total number of visitors (600) by the number of days (100). This gives us an average of 600 / 100 = 6 visitors per day. On the day we are interested in, there were 180 visitors. This means that the previous day's visitors must be accounted for in such a way that the additional 180 visitors did not significantly alter the average, given that the average remains low. Since we are only interested in the calculation for the day before the day with 180 visitors, we assume the count was about the average value. Therefore, the number of visitors the day before, based on our assumption, is approximately equal to the average, which is 6. Thus, we conclude that 6 visitors came the day before.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: After enjoying a thrilling experience at a theme park, they stopped by the London Zoo. There, Brian realized that 200 visitors had gone to the Zoo the previous day. If the total for that day was 1000 visitors, how many more visited the Zoo on that day than the day before?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more visitors went to the Zoo on the current day compared to the previous day, we first need to know the number of visitors that came on the current day. The problem states that there were a total of 1000 visitors on the current day and that there were 200 visitors on the previous day. To find the difference in the number of visitors, we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the current day's visitors. Therefore, we calculate: 1000 (current day visitors) - 200 (previous day visitors) = 800. Thus, 800 more visitors went to the Zoo on the current day than the day before.\nTherefore, the answer is (800)\n\nQ: After a satisfying meal, they ventured to admire the Taj Mahal. There were 1000 workers involved in building the Taj Mahal. There, Ava found out that 654 visitors visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 220 visitors the previous day. How many visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors who visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days, we first note the visitor counts for the specific days mentioned. For the current day, 654 visitors were recorded. For the previous day, there were 220 visitors. Assuming that these two days are part of the 70-day period, we need to estimate the average number of visitors over these 70 days. If we take both these days into account, we would have 654 + 220 = 874 visitors over these two days. This gives us an average of 874 visitors / 2 days = 437 visitors per day for these two days. To find the estimated total visitors over 70 days, we can multiply the average daily count by the total number of days: 437 visitors/day * 70 days = 30,590 visitors. We can assume that the visitor numbers remain relatively consistent each day of the period being analyzed. Therefore, the estimated total number of visitors to the Taj Mahal within 70 days is around 30,590.\nTherefore, the answer is (30590)\n\nQ: After enjoying a delightful breakfast, they decided to visit the Tower of London. There, Sarah discovered that 150 tourists had visited the Tower the day before. If there were 800 visitors on that day, how many more visitors came to the Tower that day than the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many more visitors came to the Tower on the day in question compared to the previous day, we start with the number of visitors on that day, which is 800. Next, we note the number of visitors from the previous day, which is 150. To find the difference, we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day: 800 - 150 = 650. Therefore, the number of additional visitors on that day compared to the previous day is 650.\nTherefore, the answer is (650)\n\nQuestion: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace.

We need to find how many more action figures than toy cars he got. This can be done by comparing the quantity of action figures to the quantity of toy cars that he received. The number of action figures he got is 22, and the number of toy cars he got is 12. To find the difference, we subtract the number of toy cars from the number of action figures: 22 (action figures) - 12 (toy cars) = 10. Thus, Tommy got 10 more action figures than toy cars from the garage sale.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: Jake got a collection of 250 marbles and 15 bouncy balls for his birthday. By the end of winter, he had 180 marbles remaining while not having lost any bouncy balls. How many more marbles than bouncy balls did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nJake initially had 250 marbles. By the end of winter, he had 180 marbles remaining. To find out how many marbles he lost, we subtract the remaining marbles from the initial count: 250 - 180 = 70 marbles lost. Jake also has 15 bouncy balls, and since he didn't lose any, he still has all of them. Next, we calculate how many more marbles he has compared to bouncy balls by subtracting the number of bouncy balls from the remaining marbles: 180 - 15 = 165. Therefore, Jake has 165 more marbles than bouncy balls left.\nTherefore, the answer is (165)\n\nQ: Isabella attended 10 dance classes and practiced 15 times this month. Ethan attended 5 more classes but practiced 2 less times than Isabella. How many more times did Isabella practice than attend classes?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we find out how many times Isabella practiced compared to her dance classes attended. Isabella attended 10 dance classes and practiced 15 times. The difference between her practice and classes can be calculated as follows: Practice - Classes = 15 - 10 = 5. So, Isabella practiced 5 more times than she attended classes. We then confirm Ethan's details. He attended 5 more classes than Isabella, which means he attended 10 + 5 = 15 classes. However, he practiced 2 times less than Isabella, which means he practiced 15 - 2 = 13 times. This confirms Isabella practiced 2 more times than Ethan as well. The final detail shows that Isabella’s practices exceed her class attendances by 5.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Tom received a bundle of 300 toy cars and 20 action figures for his birthday.

{"prompt": "Q: Sara was given a set of 675 beads and 50 charms for her birthday. By the end of the year, she had 500 beads left and lost no charms. How many more beads than charms did she have remaining?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSara started with 675 beads and 50 charms. By the end of the year, she had 500 beads left. To find out how many beads she has lost, we can subtract the remaining beads from the original amount: 675 - 500 = 175 beads lost. Since she lost no charms, the number of charms she has is unchanged at 50. Now, we need to find out how many more beads than charms she has remaining: 500 (remaining beads) - 50 (charms) = 450.

She had 26 bags of beads, each bag comprising 22 beads. How many containers could she fill?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine the total number of beads Emma has. She has 26 bags, each containing 22 beads. Therefore, the total number of beads is calculated as follows: total beads = number of bags × beads per bag = 26 × 22 = 572 beads. \n\nNext, we need to find out how many containers she can fill with these beads. Each container holds 14 beads. Therefore, the number of full containers she can fill is calculated as follows: number of containers = total beads ÷ beads per container = 572 ÷ 14. When we divide 572 by 14, we get 40.857, which means she can fill 40 full containers since she cannot have a fraction of a container. \n\nThus, the final answer is that Emma can fill 40 containers.\nTherefore, the answer is (40)\n\nQ: Isabella is creating friendship bracelets for her team where each bracelet consists of 6 beads.

{"prompt": "Q: For Ava's birthday, she got 7 dollars from her grandma. Her grandpa gave her 5 more dollars. After spending 3 dollars, how much more money did she receive from her grandma than from her grandpa?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nAva received 7 dollars from her grandma and 5 dollars from her grandpa. To find out how much more money she received from her grandma than her grandpa, we calculate the difference between the amounts: 7 dollars (grandma) - 5 dollars (grandpa) = 2 dollars. After spending 3 dollars, it does not affect the difference in the amounts received from her grandma and grandpa. Therefore, the answer remains 2 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQ: For Lily's achievement she was gifted 20 dollars from her parents. They gave her an additional 3 dollars. If she used 15 dollars. How much more money did she receive from her parents than she did from the extra amount?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate the total amount Lily received from her parents. They initially gave her 20 dollars and then an additional 3 dollars, making the total amount from her parents equal to 20 + 3 = 23 dollars. Next, we look at how much she used from this total amount, which is 15 dollars. Then we need to find out how much more money she received from her parents (23 dollars) than she did from the extra amount (3 dollars). We calculate this difference as follows: 23 - 3 = 20 dollars. Therefore, the difference between the amount received from her parents and the extra amount is 20 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (20)\n\nQ: At Mia's birthday, she received 4 dollars from her friend. Her other friend gave her 8 more dollars. If she spent 9 dollars, how much more money did she receive from her other friend than from her first friend?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMia received 4 dollars from her first friend and 8 dollars from her other friend. To find out how much more money she received from her other friend than from her first friend, we subtract the amount given by her first friend from the amount given by her other friend: 8 dollars - 4 dollars = 4 dollars. Therefore, the other friend gave her 4 dollars more than the first friend.\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQ: For Liam's birthday, he got 5 dollars from his dad. His mom gave him 10 more dollars. If he spent 7 dollars, how much more money did he receive from his mom than he did from his dad?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine how much money Liam received from his dad. His dad gave him 5 dollars. Next, we find out how much he received from his mom, which is 10 dollars more than what he got from his dad. Therefore, his mom gave him 5 + 10 = 15 dollars. Now, we calculate how much more money he received from his mom compared to his dad. This is 15 (mom's amount) - 5 (dad's amount) = 10 dollars. Finally, the amount he spent does not affect how much more he received from each parent. Therefore, the answer is 10.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQ: For Alice's birthday she received 10 dollars from her dad. Her mom gave her 7 more dollars. If she spent 5 dollars. How much more money did she receive from her dad than she did from her mom?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we identify how much money Alice received from each parent. Her dad gave her 10 dollars, and her mom gave her 7 dollars. Next, we need to find the difference between the amount received from her dad and the amount received from her mom. We can do this by subtracting the amount from her mom from the amount from her dad: 10 (dad) - 7 (mom) equals 3. Therefore, Alice received 3 more dollars from her dad than she did from her mom.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: For Jason's birthday he received 18 dollars from his mom. His dad gave him 5 more dollars. If he spent 7 dollars.

His mom gave him 18 dollars, and his dad gave him 5 more dollars. To find out how much more money he received from his mom than his dad, we need to calculate the difference between the amounts. We know that Jason's mom gave him 18 dollars and his dad gave him 5 dollars. Now we calculate the difference: 18 - 5 = 13. Therefore, Jason received 13 dollars more from his mom than he did from his dad. The money he spent is not relevant to this particular question.\nTherefore, the answer is (13)\n\nQ: Tina found 4 dirhams in her wallet. She acquired 56 more dirhams from a family member. After she treated herself to lunch, 56 dirhams remained. How much more money did she gain from her family member than she spent on lunch?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTina initially had 4 dirhams. She received 56 more dirhams from a family member. Therefore, the total amount of money she had after acquiring the extra dirhams is 4 + 56 = 60 dirhams. After spending some on lunch, she had 56 dirhams remaining. To find out how much she spent on lunch, we can subtract the amount she has left from the total amount she had: 60 - 56 = 4 dirhams spent on lunch. Now, to find out how much more money she gained from her family member than what she spent on lunch, we subtract the amount spent on lunch from the amount received: 56 - 4 = 52 dirhams. Thus, the amount she gained from her family member is 52 dirhams more than what she spent on lunch.\nTherefore, the answer is (52)\n\nQ: On Emma's birthday, she was gifted 8 dollars by her aunt.

{"prompt": "Q: After enjoying a delightful breakfast, they decided to visit the Tower of London. There, Sarah discovered that 150 tourists had visited the Tower the day before. If there were 800 visitors on that day, how many more visitors came to the Tower that day than the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many more visitors came to the Tower on the day in question compared to the previous day, we start with the number of visitors on that day, which is 800. Next, we note the number of visitors from the previous day, which is 150. To find the difference, we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day: 800 - 150 = 650. Therefore, the number of additional visitors on that day compared to the previous day is 650.\nTherefore, the answer is (650)\n\nQ: After enjoying a delightful lunch, they visited the Eiffel Tower. There, Sarah realized that 412 tourists arrived at the Eiffel Tower that day. If there were 391 tourists the previous day and 678 tourists the day before that. How many visited the Eiffel Tower within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of tourists who visited the Eiffel Tower within the past 89 days, we can analyze the provided data. We know the number of tourists for the last three days: 412 for today, 391 for the previous day, and 678 for the day before that. We don't have specific data for the other 86 days. However, we can calculate the total for the three days we have and denote the remaining 86 days as an unknown. \n\nFirst, we need to sum the tourists from the three known days: \n412 (today) + 391 (yesterday) + 678 (day before yesterday) = 1481 tourists for these three days. \n\nSince we lack exact data for the remaining days, we cannot provide a precise number for the entire 89-day period. Generally, historical average values or trends could be considered for an accurate estimate, but those are not provided in this case. Therefore, the total number of visitors over the past 89 days remains undetermined with the given information. \n\nThus, under these circumstances, we can only present the total of the currently known days, which is 1481 tourists.\nTherefore, the answer is (1481)\n\nQ: After a satisfying meal, they ventured to admire the Taj Mahal. There were 1000 workers involved in building the Taj Mahal. There, Ava found out that 654 visitors visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 220 visitors the previous day. How many visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors who visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days, we first note the visitor counts for the specific days mentioned. For the current day, 654 visitors were recorded. For the previous day, there were 220 visitors. Assuming that these two days are part of the 70-day period, we need to estimate the average number of visitors over these 70 days. If we take both these days into account, we would have 654 + 220 = 874 visitors over these two days. This gives us an average of 874 visitors / 2 days = 437 visitors per day for these two days. To find the estimated total visitors over 70 days, we can multiply the average daily count by the total number of days: 437 visitors/day * 70 days = 30,590 visitors. We can assume that the visitor numbers remain relatively consistent each day of the period being analyzed. Therefore, the estimated total number of visitors to the Taj Mahal within 70 days is around 30,590.\nTherefore, the answer is (30590)\n\nQ: After enjoying a thrilling experience at a theme park, they stopped by the London Zoo. There, Brian realized that 200 visitors had gone to the Zoo the previous day. If the total for that day was 1000 visitors, how many more visited the Zoo on that day than the day before?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more visitors went to the Zoo on the current day compared to the previous day, we first need to know the number of visitors that came on the current day. The problem states that there were a total of 1000 visitors on the current day and that there were 200 visitors on the previous day. To find the difference in the number of visitors, we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the current day's visitors. Therefore, we calculate: 1000 (current day visitors) - 200 (previous day visitors) = 800. Thus, 800 more visitors went to the Zoo on the current day than the day before.\nTherefore, the answer is (800)\n\nQ: After indulging in a delightful snack, they went to visit the Tower of London. There were 30 crowns in the Tower of London. There, Emily learned that 623 visitors came to the Tower of London that day. If there were 170 visitors the day before. How many visited the Tower of London within 35 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the total number of visitors to the Tower of London over 35 days, we start with the information given. We know that on the most recent day there were 623 visitors. The day before, there were 170 visitors. However, we don't have daily visitor numbers for the entire 35 days, so we need to make an assumption. One method is to assume a consistent average based on the last few known days. We have 623 visitors on the latest day and 170 on the day before that. Adding these two gives us a total of 793 visitors over a 2-day span. This means, on average, there were 793 / 2 = 396.5 visitors per day for those two days. Assuming this average holds over 35 days: 396.5 visitors/day * 35 days = 13,927.5 visitors in total. Since the number of visitors must be rounded to whole numbers, we round down to 13,927. Thus, the total number of visitors over this period can be approximated by this average calculation.\nTherefore, the answer is (13927)\n\nQ: After savoring a fantastic dinner, they made their way to the Sydney Opera House. There, Emma found out that 754 attendees were at the Sydney Opera House that day. If there were 689 attendees the previous day and 820 attendees the day before that. How many visited the Sydney Opera House within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total number of attendees at the Sydney Opera House over the past 89 days, we need to find an average daily attendance number based on the figures provided. We have data for three consecutive days: 820 attendees (two days ago), 689 attendees (yesterday), and 754 attendees (today). We can calculate the average of these three days and then multiply that by the number of days we want to estimate (89 days) for an approximation. \n\n1. Add the known daily attendees: 820 + 689 + 754 = 2263. \n2. Divide by the number of days represented (which is 3) to find the average: 2263 / 3 ≈ 754.33. \n3. Multiply this average by 89 to estimate attendance over those 89 days: 754.33 * 89 ≈ 66934. \n\nThus, we estimate that approximately 66934 attendees visited the Sydney Opera House in the past 89 days, assuming attendance was consistent during that period. Therefore, the answer is (66934).\nTherefore, the answer is (66934)\n\nQ: After sharing a light snack, they set off to visit the Statue of Liberty. There, Lily learned that 250 individuals toured the Statue of Liberty that day. If there were 230 individuals the previous day and 300 individuals the day before that. How many visited the Statue of Liberty within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors to the Statue of Liberty over the past 89 days, we need to calculate an average daily total based on the provided data. We have the visitor counts for three consecutive days: 300, 230, and 250. First, we can find the average number of visitors for these three days: (300 + 230 + 250) / 3 = 780 / 3 = 260. The average over these days can give us an insight into the number of visitors in a longer timeframe, such as 89 days. Assuming that the average number of visitors remains relatively constant, we can then multiply this average by the total number of days we want to calculate: 260 (average visitors per day) * 89 (days) = 23040. Therefore, over the past 89 days, an estimated total of 23040 individuals visited the Statue of Liberty.\nTherefore, the answer is (23040)\n\nQ: After relishing a rich dessert, they opted to take a tour of the Taj Mahal. There, Jack noted that 420 patrons visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 380 patrons the previous day and 500 patrons the day before that. How many visited the Taj Mahal within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many patrons visited the Taj Mahal in the past 89 days, we need to compute the total based on the given visits for the last three days and estimate for the previous days. We have the following information: 500 patrons two days ago, 380 patrons one day ago, and 420 patrons today. We can average the number of patrons or assume a similar pattern continues across the previous days to extrapolate a rough estimate. It would be reasonable to calculate an average based on these three days: (500 + 380 + 420) / 3 = 433.33. We can round this number to 433 for simplicity. Now, if we assume that this average holds for each of the 89 days, we calculate the total by multiplying: 433 patrons/day * 89 days = 38,557 patrons. Therefore, the total number of patrons who visited the Taj Mahal over the past 89 days is approximately 38,557.\nTherefore, the answer is (38557)\n\nQuestion: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace.

{"prompt": "Q: Oliver built 14 birdhouses in his yard. After a storm came, 5 were destroyed. Then he constructed 3 more birdhouses. How many birdhouses does he have now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nOliver initially built 14 birdhouses. After a storm, 5 of them were destroyed. To find out how many birdhouses he has left after the storm, we subtract the destroyed birdhouses from the total: 14 - 5 = 9. Then, he constructed 3 more birdhouses. To find the total number of birdhouses now, we add the new birdhouses to the remaining ones: 9 + 3 = 12. Thus, after these calculations, Oliver now has 12 birdhouses.\nTherefore, the answer is (12)\n\nQ: In a park, there were ducks and rabbits. The total number of animals in the park was 65. If 30 ducks and 28 rabbits were hiding, how many animals were not hiding in all?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the total number of animals in the park, which is 65. Out of these, 30 ducks are hiding and 28 rabbits are hiding. To find out how many animals are hiding in total, we add the number of hiding ducks and hiding rabbits. So, we have 30 + 28 = 58 animals hiding. Next, we need to find out how many animals are not hiding. We subtract the total number of hiding animals from the total number of animals in the park: 65 - 58 = 7. Therefore, the number of animals that are not hiding is 7.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: In a forest, there were birds and squirrels. The total number of animals in the forest was 50. If 18 birds and 25 squirrels were hiding, how many animals were not hiding in all?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the number of animals not hiding, we first determine how many animals are hiding. We know 18 birds and 25 squirrels are hiding. Adding these together gives us: 18 (birds) + 25 (squirrels) = 43 animals hiding. Now, to find the number of animals that are not hiding, we subtract the number of hiding animals from the total number of animals in the forest: 50 (total animals) - 43 (hiding animals) = 7 animals not hiding. Therefore, the answer is (7).\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Autumn has arrived and various mammals are searching for food underground. There were 50 mammal families in the forest. If 12 mammal families burrowed away for winter, how many more mammal families stayed behind than those that burrowed away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we start with the total number of mammal families in the forest, which is 50. Next, we identify that 12 mammal families burrowed away for the winter. To find out how many mammal families stayed behind, we subtract the number of families that burrowed away from the total number of families. This gives us 50 - 12 = 38 mammal families that stayed behind. Now, to determine how many more families stayed behind than those that burrowed away, we subtract the number of families that burrowed away from those that stayed behind: 38 - 12 = 26. Therefore, there are 26 more mammal families that stayed behind than those that burrowed away.\nTherefore, the answer is (26)\n\nQ: Jason was assisting his grandfather in building birdhouses and together they constructed 20 birdhouses. They used 5 birdhouses per tree and only 25 birdhouses were hung per tree. How many trees did they have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, Jason and his grandfather constructed a total of 20 birdhouses. Each tree can hold 25 birdhouses, but since they only used 20 birdhouses, we need to determine how many trees can be filled with these 20 houses. According to the problem statement, each tree has 5 birdhouses hung per tree. Therefore, we can calculate the number of trees needed by dividing the total number of birdhouses by the number of birdhouses hung per tree. The calculation would be: 20 birdhouses / 5 birdhouses per tree = 4 trees. Thus, they will need 4 trees to hang 20 birdhouses.\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQ: The mating season is almost over, and several rabbit families are looking for safer places. There were 40 rabbit families in the meadow. If 8 rabbit families dashed away for safety, how many more rabbit families remained than those that dashed away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nStart with the total number of rabbit families, which is 40. Then, subtract the number of families that dashed away for safety, which is 8. The calculation is: 40 - 8 = 32. Now, we need to find the difference between the remaining families and those that dashed away. The number of remaining families is 32 and the number of families that dashed away is 8. The calculation for the difference is: 32 - 8 = 24. Therefore, there are 24 more rabbit families remaining than those that dashed away.\nTherefore, the answer is (24)\n\nQ: There were a few dogs playing in the park. 2 more dogs arrived to join them. If there are a total of 8 dogs playing now, how many dogs were there at the beginning?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet's denote the initial number of dogs as X. According to the problem, 2 more dogs arrived, so the total number of dogs becomes X + 2. We know from the problem that this total is equal to 8 dogs. Therefore, we can set up the equation: X + 2 = 8. To find the initial number of dogs, we need to solve for X by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation: X = 8 - 2. Simplifying this gives us X = 6. Thus, there were initially 6 dogs playing in the park.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: The rainy months have begun, and many bird families are relocating to drier regions. There were 110 bird families nesting in the trees. If 25 bird families left for the drier months, how many more bird families stayed behind than those that left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 110 bird families nesting in the trees. Out of these, 25 bird families left for the drier months. To find out how many bird families stayed behind, we need to subtract the number of families that left from the initial number: 110 - 25 = 85. Now, we need to find out how many more bird families stayed behind than those that left. We calculate this by subtracting the number of families that left from the number that stayed: 85 - 25 = 60. Therefore, 60 more bird families stayed behind than those that left.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQuestion: 6 birds were sitting on the fence. 4 more birds and 8 more storks came to join them.

She ate 5 pieces, so we subtract 5 from 14 to find out how many she has left. Lucy then gave 7 pieces to her brother. To find out how many more pieces she gave to her brother than those she ate, we compare the 7 pieces given away to the 5 pieces she ate. We can calculate the difference: 7 (pieces given to her brother) - 5 (pieces eaten) = 2. Therefore, Lucy gave 2 more pieces of candy to her brother than she ate.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQ: A bakery had a total of 24 pastries of which 12 were chocolate croissants and the rest were fruit tarts. They also had 40 cookies. How many fruit tarts did they have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the number of fruit tarts, we need to first determine how many pastries are fruit tarts. We know that the total number of pastries is 24 and that there are 12 chocolate croissants. Therefore, we can calculate the number of fruit tarts by subtracting the number of chocolate croissants from the total number of pastries: 24 (total pastries) - 12 (chocolate croissants) = 12 (fruit tarts).\nTherefore, the answer is (12)\n\nQ: Andrew is packing picnic baskets for a group outing.

{"prompt": "Q: Following a refreshing afternoon snack, they made their way to the Eiffel Tower. There, Emma found out that 80 visitors explored the Eiffel Tower the day before. If 2,300 people visited the Eiffel Tower in the last 30 days, how many visitors were there on that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the number of visitors to the Eiffel Tower on the specific day mentioned, we first note that 2,300 people visited over the last 30 days. We can find the average number of visitors per day by dividing the total number of visitors by the number of days: 2,300 visitors / 30 days = 76.67 visitors/day. Next, we are given that 80 visitors explored the Eiffel Tower the day before the specific day being analyzed. We can then assume that the visitation trend might mean that the number of visitors could vary slightly from day to day. However, for the day in question, since no specific information about a change in visitor numbers is given, we can take the number of visitors from the previous day as a reliable estimate for that day, which is 80 visitors. Therefore, the answer is (80).\nTherefore, the answer is (80)\n\nQ: After a satisfying meal, they ventured to admire the Taj Mahal. There were 1000 workers involved in building the Taj Mahal. There, Ava found out that 654 visitors visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 220 visitors the previous day. How many visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors who visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days, we first note the visitor counts for the specific days mentioned. For the current day, 654 visitors were recorded. For the previous day, there were 220 visitors. Assuming that these two days are part of the 70-day period, we need to estimate the average number of visitors over these 70 days. If we take both these days into account, we would have 654 + 220 = 874 visitors over these two days. This gives us an average of 874 visitors / 2 days = 437 visitors per day for these two days. To find the estimated total visitors over 70 days, we can multiply the average daily count by the total number of days: 437 visitors/day * 70 days = 30,590 visitors. We can assume that the visitor numbers remain relatively consistent each day of the period being analyzed. Therefore, the estimated total number of visitors to the Taj Mahal within 70 days is around 30,590.\nTherefore, the answer is (30590)\n\nQ: After enjoying a satisfying brunch, they decided to explore the Tower of London. There, John found out that 90 visitors visited the Tower on the previous day. If 2,400 people came to the Tower in the last 40 days, how many visitors were there that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many visitors were there that day, we first need to find the average number of visitors per day over the last 40 days. We can do this by dividing the total number of visitors by the number of days. The total number of visitors over the last 40 days is 2,400. Thus, we calculate 2400 visitors / 40 days = 60 visitors per day on average. Now, we know that 90 visitors visited the Tower the previous day. Since this number (90) is higher than the average (60), we conclude that the number of visitors on that day is simply 90. Therefore, we do not need any further calculations regarding variation, and we state the conclusion clearly.\nTherefore, the answer is (90)\n\nQ: After enjoying a delightful lunch, they visited the Eiffel Tower. There, Sarah realized that 412 tourists arrived at the Eiffel Tower that day. If there were 391 tourists the previous day and 678 tourists the day before that. How many visited the Eiffel Tower within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of tourists who visited the Eiffel Tower within the past 89 days, we can analyze the provided data. We know the number of tourists for the last three days: 412 for today, 391 for the previous day, and 678 for the day before that. We don't have specific data for the other 86 days. However, we can calculate the total for the three days we have and denote the remaining 86 days as an unknown. \n\nFirst, we need to sum the tourists from the three known days: \n412 (today) + 391 (yesterday) + 678 (day before yesterday) = 1481 tourists for these three days. \n\nSince we lack exact data for the remaining days, we cannot provide a precise number for the entire 89-day period. Generally, historical average values or trends could be considered for an accurate estimate, but those are not provided in this case. Therefore, the total number of visitors over the past 89 days remains undetermined with the given information. \n\nThus, under these circumstances, we can only present the total of the currently known days, which is 1481 tourists.\nTherefore, the answer is (1481)\n\nQ: After sharing a light snack, they set off to visit the Statue of Liberty. There, Lily learned that 250 individuals toured the Statue of Liberty that day. If there were 230 individuals the previous day and 300 individuals the day before that. How many visited the Statue of Liberty within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors to the Statue of Liberty over the past 89 days, we need to calculate an average daily total based on the provided data. We have the visitor counts for three consecutive days: 300, 230, and 250. First, we can find the average number of visitors for these three days: (300 + 230 + 250) / 3 = 780 / 3 = 260. The average over these days can give us an insight into the number of visitors in a longer timeframe, such as 89 days. Assuming that the average number of visitors remains relatively constant, we can then multiply this average by the total number of days we want to calculate: 260 (average visitors per day) * 89 (days) = 23040. Therefore, over the past 89 days, an estimated total of 23040 individuals visited the Statue of Liberty.\nTherefore, the answer is (23040)\n\nQ: After indulging in a delightful snack, they went to visit the Tower of London. There were 30 crowns in the Tower of London. There, Emily learned that 623 visitors came to the Tower of London that day. If there were 170 visitors the day before. How many visited the Tower of London within 35 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the total number of visitors to the Tower of London over 35 days, we start with the information given. We know that on the most recent day there were 623 visitors. The day before, there were 170 visitors. However, we don't have daily visitor numbers for the entire 35 days, so we need to make an assumption. One method is to assume a consistent average based on the last few known days. We have 623 visitors on the latest day and 170 on the day before that. Adding these two gives us a total of 793 visitors over a 2-day span. This means, on average, there were 793 / 2 = 396.5 visitors per day for those two days. Assuming this average holds over 35 days: 396.5 visitors/day * 35 days = 13,927.5 visitors in total. Since the number of visitors must be rounded to whole numbers, we round down to 13,927. Thus, the total number of visitors over this period can be approximated by this average calculation.\nTherefore, the answer is (13927)\n\nQ: After enjoying a delightful breakfast, they decided to visit the Tower of London. There, Sarah discovered that 150 tourists had visited the Tower the day before. If there were 800 visitors on that day, how many more visitors came to the Tower that day than the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many more visitors came to the Tower on the day in question compared to the previous day, we start with the number of visitors on that day, which is 800. Next, we note the number of visitors from the previous day, which is 150. To find the difference, we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day: 800 - 150 = 650. Therefore, the number of additional visitors on that day compared to the previous day is 650.\nTherefore, the answer is (650)\n\nQ: After relishing a rich dessert, they opted to take a tour of the Taj Mahal. There, Jack noted that 420 patrons visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 380 patrons the previous day and 500 patrons the day before that. How many visited the Taj Mahal within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many patrons visited the Taj Mahal in the past 89 days, we need to compute the total based on the given visits for the last three days and estimate for the previous days. We have the following information: 500 patrons two days ago, 380 patrons one day ago, and 420 patrons today. We can average the number of patrons or assume a similar pattern continues across the previous days to extrapolate a rough estimate. It would be reasonable to calculate an average based on these three days: (500 + 380 + 420) / 3 = 433.33. We can round this number to 433 for simplicity. Now, if we assume that this average holds for each of the 89 days, we calculate the total by multiplying: 433 patrons/day * 89 days = 38,557 patrons. Therefore, the total number of patrons who visited the Taj Mahal over the past 89 days is approximately 38,557.\nTherefore, the answer is (38557)\n\nQuestion: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 45 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If 829 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 85 days.

{"prompt": "Q: Rachel is planting flowers in her garden. She bought 11 pots, with each pot containing the same number of flower seeds. How many seeds are in each pot?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe problem does not specify the total number of flower seeds purchased by Rachel. Therefore, without this information, we cannot directly determine how many seeds are in each pot. If we had the total number of seeds, we could divide that number by 11 (the number of pots) to find the number of seeds per pot. However, since that information is missing, we cannot provide a numerical answer.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (undefined).)\n\nQ: Claire owned 8 plants in her garden. She purchased 22 additional plants. After giving some away, she had 14 plants left. How many more plants did she give away than she purchased?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nClaire initially owned 8 plants and purchased 22 more, which means she had 8 + 22 = 30 plants in total. After giving some plants away, she ended up with 14 plants left. To find out how many plants she gave away, we calculate the difference between the total plants she had and the plants she has left: 30 - 14 = 16 plants. This means she gave away 16 plants. Now, to find out how many more plants she gave away than she purchased, we compare the number of plants she gave away (16) to the number of plants she purchased (22). The number of plants she gave away (16) is 22 - 16 = 6 plants less than what she purchased. Therefore, she did not give away more; instead, she gave away 6 plants less than she purchased. Since the question focuses on how many more she gave away than purchased, the result is negative. Thus, the answer is -6, indicating how many fewer plants were given away.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (-6).)\n\nQ: There were 9 daffodils in the bouquet. Tom collected some more daffodils from his yard which had a total of 32 daffodils. There are now 18 daffodils in the bouquet. How many daffodils did he collect?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 9 daffodils in the bouquet. Tom then collected some more daffodils to add to the bouquet, resulting in a total of 18 daffodils in the bouquet after his addition. To find out how many daffodils he collected, we can set up the equation: 9 (initial daffodils) + x (daffodils collected) = 18 (new total). Solving for x gives us x = 18 - 9 = 9. Therefore, Tom collected 9 daffodils.\nTherefore, the answer is (9)\n\nQ: At the beginning, there were 15 lilies and 72 sunflowers in the field. Sarah gathered some additional lilies and sunflowers from her backyard. Now, there are 78 sunflowers and 18 lilies in the field. How many lilies did she gather?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nAt the beginning, there were 15 lilies and 72 sunflowers. After Sarah gathered more from her backyard, the total became 18 lilies and 78 sunflowers. We can calculate the number of lilies and sunflowers she gathered by finding the difference between the initial and final amounts. For lilies: 18 (final) - 15 (initial) = 3, which indicates that she must have gathered 3 additional lilies. For sunflowers: 78 (final) - 72 (initial) = 6, indicating she gathered 6 sunflowers. However, the question specifically asks how many lilies she gathered. Therefore, the answer is (3).\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: There were 8 daisies in the jar. Emily chose some more daisies from her floral patch which had a total of 50 daisies. There are now 30 daisies in the jar. How many daisies did she choose?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 8 daisies in the jar. Emily took additional daisies from her floral patch. After adding the daisies she chose, the total number of daisies in the jar increased to 30. To find out how many daisies she chose, we subtract the initial number of daisies from the final count: 30 - 8 = 22. Therefore, Emily chose 22 daisies from her floral patch.\nTherefore, the answer is (22)\n\nQ: Maria had 7 plants in her garden. Later she added 5 more plants to the garden and removed some of the old ones. If there are 9 plants in her garden now, how many plants did she remove from the garden?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMaria initially had 7 plants. She then added 5 more plants, making the total number of plants 7 + 5 = 12. Now, there are only 9 plants left in the garden. To find out how many plants she removed, we subtract the current number of plants from the total number she had after the addition: 12 - 9 = 3. Therefore, Maria removed 3 plants from her garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: There were 12 carnation flowers in the jar. Lucas took some more carnations from his garden which had a total of 15 carnations. There are now 27 carnations in the jar. How many carnations are left in the garden?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 12 carnations in the jar. Lucas took some more from his garden, which had a total of 15 carnations. After adding the carnations from his garden to the jar, the total number of carnations in the jar became 27. To find out how many carnations Lucas took from the garden, we can set up the equation: 12 (initial) + x (flowers taken) = 27 (total after taking). Solving for x gives us x = 27 - 12 = 15. Thus, Lucas took all 15 from his garden. Since he started with 15 in the garden and took all of them, there are now 15 - 15 = 0 left in the garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: There were 10 carnation flowers and 40 daffodils in the arrangement. Sarah added some more carnations and daffodils from her floral supply. Now there are 12 carnations and 50 daffodils in the arrangement. How many carnations did she add?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 10 carnations in the arrangement. After Sarah added some more, the total number of carnations became 12. This means that the number of carnations Sarah added can be found by subtracting the initial number of carnations from the final total. Therefore, we perform the calculation: 12 (final number of carnations) - 10 (initial number of carnations) = 2 (number of carnations added).\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQuestion: Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds.

{"prompt": "Q: Sophie is making pancakes. The recipe needs 3 cups of flour, 2 cups of milk, and 1 cup of sugar. She has already added 1 cup of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSophie needs a total of 3 cups of flour for the recipe. She has already added 1 cup of flour, so she needs to add 3 - 1 = 2 more cups of flour. The recipe also requires 1 cup of sugar. We need to find out how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar she needs to add. She needs to add 2 cups of flour and 0 cups of sugar, since she already has all the required sugar. Therefore, she needs to add 2 - 0 = 2 more cups of flour than cups of sugar.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQ: Sara is making a salad. The recipe asks for 2 cups of lettuce and 6 cups of tomatoes. She has already added some lettuce. If she still needs 1 more cup of lettuce than tomatoes, how many more cups of lettuce does she need to add?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet's denote the amount of lettuce Sara has added as L and the amount of tomatoes as T. According to the recipe, she needs a total of 2 cups of lettuce and 6 cups of tomatoes. The problem states that she still needs 1 more cup of lettuce than tomatoes, meaning if we denote the amount of lettuce she still needs as x, then: x = T + 1. We know T is the total amount of tomatoes she needs, which is 6 cups. Thus, we have: x = 6 + 1 = 7 cups of lettuce that she needs in total. So the total amount of lettuce she needs is 7 cups. She has already added some lettuce, which is L cups. We want to find out how many more cups of lettuce she needs to add: Additional lettuce needed = Total lettuce needed - Already added lettuce = 7 - L. However, the actual value of L is not provided. We only know she needs more lettuce than the total of T by 1 cup. Therefore, if she needs to add 1 more cup than the amount of tomatoes, she needs to add enough lettuce to reach that target of 7 cups in total, which leads us to conclude that she needs 1 cup more than the 6 cups of tomatoes she has. Thus, she needs to add additional lettuce but the amount already added needs to be subtracted from the total amount she needs, which is dependent on how much she has already added.\nTherefore, the answer is (The problem does not provide the current amount of lettuce she has added, so we cannot determine how many more cups of lettuce she needs without that information.)\n\nQ: Lisa is preparing a soup. The recipe asks for 8 cups of stock, 2 cups of carrots, and 1 cup of onions. She has already put in 4 cups of stock. How many more cups of stock than cups of onions does she need to add now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe recipe requires 8 cups of stock in total, and Lisa has already added 4 cups. Therefore, she needs to add 8 - 4 = 4 more cups of stock. The recipe also requires 1 cup of onions. To find out how many more cups of stock than cups of onions Lisa needs to add now, we compare the 4 cups of stock to the 1 cup of onions. Thus, she needs 4 - 1 = 3 more cups of stock than cups of onions.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: Anna is making a smoothie. The recipe needs 4 cups of yogurt, 6 cups of fruits, and 1 cup of honey. She has already poured in 2 cups of yogurt. How many more cups of yogurt than cups of honey does she need to add now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine how many cups of yogurt Anna still needs to pour. The recipe calls for 4 cups of yogurt, and she has already added 2 cups. Therefore, she needs 4 - 2 = 2 more cups of yogurt. Next, we determine the number of cups of honey needed according to the recipe. The recipe states that 1 cup of honey is required. Now we find out how many more cups of yogurt she needs compared to the cups of honey. She needs 2 more cups of yogurt and only 1 cup of honey, so the difference is 2 - 1 = 1 cup. Thus, Anna needs 1 more cup of yogurt than cups of honey.\nTherefore, the answer is (1)\n\nQ: David is preparing cookies. The recipe calls for 5 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar.

David has already added 2 cups of flour. To find out how much more flour he needs to add, we subtract the amount of flour he has already added from the total amount required: 5 cups (total) - 2 cups (already added) = 3 cups. Therefore, David needs to add 3 more cups of flour.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: Alex is baking cookies. The recipe calls for 8 cups of chocolate chips and 5 cups of sugar. He has already used 6 cups of chocolate chips. How many more cups of sugar than cups of chocolate chips does he need to add now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe recipe requires a total of 8 cups of chocolate chips and 5 cups of sugar. Alex has already used 6 cups of chocolate chips, so he still needs to add 2 cups of chocolate chips (8 - 6 = 2). The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar, and since he has not mentioned using any sugar yet, he needs to add all 5 cups of sugar. Now, to find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of chocolate chips he needs to add, we calculate the difference between the cups of sugar needed (5) and the cups of chocolate chips he still needs to add (2). Therefore, 5 - 2 = 3. Alex needs to add 3 more cups of sugar than cups of chocolate chips.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: Lisa is making cookies. The recipe asks for 4 cups of chocolate chips and 10 cups of flour. She has already used 6 cups of flour and 12 cups of chocolate chips. How many more cups of flour does she need to add?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine how much flour the recipe requires in total, which is 10 cups. Lisa has already used 6 cups of flour. To find out how much more flour is needed, we subtract the amount of flour she has already used from the total requirement: 10 cups (total requirement) - 6 cups (used) = 4 cups (needed). Therefore, Lisa needs to add 4 more cups of flour.\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQ: Sophia is making pancakes. The recipe calls for 3 cups of flour, 2 cups of milk, and 1 cup of sugar.

Sophia has already added 1 cup of milk, so she needs to add 2 - 1 = 1 more cup of milk. The recipe also calls for 1 cup of sugar. Therefore, she needs to find out how many more cups of milk she needs to add compared to cups of sugar in the recipe. Since she needs to add 1 cup of milk and the recipe requires 1 cup of sugar, the difference is 1 - 1 = 0. Thus, she does not need to add any more cups of milk than cups of sugar.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQuestion: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar.

{"prompt": "Q: After indulging in a grand feast, they made their way to the Great Wall of China. At the wall, Emma discovered that 1,200 visitors came to the wall on the previous day. If there were 285 visitors on that day, how many visited the Great Wall within 25 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many visitors are coming to the Great Wall of China on average each day over the 25-day period. We know from the previous day that there were 1,200 visitors and on the current day there are 285 visitors. These numbers suggest that visitation can fluctuate greatly. We assume that the current day's data (285 visitors) might not represent the average, so we will calculate the total visitors over the 25 days by adding the visitors from the previous day of 1,200 to the current day's 285. Hence, the total visitors can be calculated as the sum of the two days multiplied over the 25 days. So, (1,200 + 285) * 25 gives the total visitors for that duration. We add 1,200 + 285 to get 1,485 visitors total for those two entries. Multiplying by 25 gives 1,485 * 25 = 37,125. Therefore, the total number of visitors over 25 days is calculated at 37,125.\nTherefore, the answer is (37125)\n\nQ: After relishing a rich dessert, they opted to take a tour of the Taj Mahal. There, Jack noted that 420 patrons visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 380 patrons the previous day and 500 patrons the day before that. How many visited the Taj Mahal within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many patrons visited the Taj Mahal in the past 89 days, we need to compute the total based on the given visits for the last three days and estimate for the previous days. We have the following information: 500 patrons two days ago, 380 patrons one day ago, and 420 patrons today. We can average the number of patrons or assume a similar pattern continues across the previous days to extrapolate a rough estimate. It would be reasonable to calculate an average based on these three days: (500 + 380 + 420) / 3 = 433.33. We can round this number to 433 for simplicity. Now, if we assume that this average holds for each of the 89 days, we calculate the total by multiplying: 433 patrons/day * 89 days = 38,557 patrons. Therefore, the total number of patrons who visited the Taj Mahal over the past 89 days is approximately 38,557.\nTherefore, the answer is (38557)\n\nQ: After a satisfying meal, they ventured to admire the Taj Mahal. There were 1000 workers involved in building the Taj Mahal. There, Ava found out that 654 visitors visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 220 visitors the previous day. How many visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors who visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days, we first note the visitor counts for the specific days mentioned. For the current day, 654 visitors were recorded. For the previous day, there were 220 visitors. Assuming that these two days are part of the 70-day period, we need to estimate the average number of visitors over these 70 days. If we take both these days into account, we would have 654 + 220 = 874 visitors over these two days. This gives us an average of 874 visitors / 2 days = 437 visitors per day for these two days. To find the estimated total visitors over 70 days, we can multiply the average daily count by the total number of days: 437 visitors/day * 70 days = 30,590 visitors. We can assume that the visitor numbers remain relatively consistent each day of the period being analyzed. Therefore, the estimated total number of visitors to the Taj Mahal within 70 days is around 30,590.\nTherefore, the answer is (30590)\n\nQ: After enjoying a big breakfast, they went to explore the Eiffel Tower. There were 50 elevators in the Eiffel Tower. There, Sarah discovered that 780 visitors came to the Eiffel Tower that day. If there were 300 visitors the previous day. How many visited the Eiffel Tower within 30 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors to the Eiffel Tower within 30 days, we need to establish the daily visitor trend. Given that on one particular day there were 780 visitors and the previous day there were 300 visitors, we can calculate an average or assume these numbers represent the start of a pattern. However, without additional data for the other days, we can only calculate the total based on these figures. If we take 780 visitors as a representation for the number of visitors for one day and assume that this figure stays consistent for 30 days, then the total can be calculated by multiplying the daily visitors by the number of days. Hence, the total number of visitors would be: 780 visitors/day * 30 days = 23400 visitors over 30 days. We will assume that no significant fluctuation in daily visitors occurs during those 30 days for this calculation.\nTherefore, the answer is (23400)\n\nQ: After sharing a light snack, they set off to visit the Statue of Liberty. There, Lily learned that 250 individuals toured the Statue of Liberty that day. If there were 230 individuals the previous day and 300 individuals the day before that. How many visited the Statue of Liberty within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors to the Statue of Liberty over the past 89 days, we need to calculate an average daily total based on the provided data. We have the visitor counts for three consecutive days: 300, 230, and 250. First, we can find the average number of visitors for these three days: (300 + 230 + 250) / 3 = 780 / 3 = 260. The average over these days can give us an insight into the number of visitors in a longer timeframe, such as 89 days. Assuming that the average number of visitors remains relatively constant, we can then multiply this average by the total number of days we want to calculate: 260 (average visitors per day) * 89 (days) = 23040. Therefore, over the past 89 days, an estimated total of 23040 individuals visited the Statue of Liberty.\nTherefore, the answer is (23040)\n\nQ: Following a refreshing afternoon snack, they made their way to the Eiffel Tower. There, Emma found out that 80 visitors explored the Eiffel Tower the day before. If 2,300 people visited the Eiffel Tower in the last 30 days, how many visitors were there on that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the number of visitors to the Eiffel Tower on the specific day mentioned, we first note that 2,300 people visited over the last 30 days. We can find the average number of visitors per day by dividing the total number of visitors by the number of days: 2,300 visitors / 30 days = 76.67 visitors/day. Next, we are given that 80 visitors explored the Eiffel Tower the day before the specific day being analyzed. We can then assume that the visitation trend might mean that the number of visitors could vary slightly from day to day. However, for the day in question, since no specific information about a change in visitor numbers is given, we can take the number of visitors from the previous day as a reliable estimate for that day, which is 80 visitors.

If there were 150 visitors on that day, how many visited the Taj Mahal within 25 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many visitors attended the Taj Mahal in 25 days, we first need to understand the visitor data. On the previous day, there were 600 visitors, and on the day of Oliver's visit, there were 150 visitors. We can assume the total number of visitors over the last 25 days follows a consistent trend and averages out. First, we average the number of visitors over these two days: (600 + 150) / 2 = 375. If we assume this average holds over 25 days, we calculate the total visitors as 375 visitors per day times 25 days. Total visitors = 375 * 25 = 9375.\nTherefore, the answer is (9375)\n\nQ: After indulging in a delightful snack, they went to visit the Tower of London. There were 30 crowns in the Tower of London. There, Emily learned that 623 visitors came to the Tower of London that day. If there were 170 visitors the day before. How many visited the Tower of London within 35 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the total number of visitors to the Tower of London over 35 days, we start with the information given. We know that on the most recent day there were 623 visitors. The day before, there were 170 visitors. However, we don't have daily visitor numbers for the entire 35 days, so we need to make an assumption. One method is to assume a consistent average based on the last few known days. We have 623 visitors on the latest day and 170 on the day before that. Adding these two gives us a total of 793 visitors over a 2-day span. This means, on average, there were 793 / 2 = 396.5 visitors per day for those two days. Assuming this average holds over 35 days: 396.5 visitors/day * 35 days = 13,927.5 visitors in total. Since the number of visitors must be rounded to whole numbers, we round down to 13,927. Thus, the total number of visitors over this period can be approximated by this average calculation.\nTherefore, the answer is (13927)\n\nQuestion: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace.

Now she has 55 marbles in her collection. How many more marbles did Emma find than those she threw away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many more marbles Emma found than those she threw away, we first need to determine how many marbles she had before throwing any away. She found 80 marbles and threw away 15. The total number of marbles she would have after finding the marbles and before throwing away some is 80 marbles - 15 old marbles = 65 marbles. However, the problem states that she now has 55 marbles in her collection. This means that the total number of marbles she initially had (80) minus the ones she threw away (15) is 65. But already she has 55 marbles. Therefore, the number of marbles she found is 80 and the number of marbles she threw away is 15. Now we need to calculate the difference: 80 (found) - 15 (thrown away) = 65. Since we only need the comparison of how many more she found than what she threw away, we simply calculate: 80 (found) - 15 (thrown away) = 65.

We know that 120 books were sold during the spring fair. Therefore, we can calculate the number of books sold at the summer festival by subtracting the books sold at the spring fair from the total books sold: 300 (total books) - 120 (spring fair books) = 180 (summer festival books).\nTherefore, the answer is (180)\n\nQ: The Book Nook bookstore profits $25 for each book sold. During the summer sale and winter sale, they sold a total of 200 books. They sold 150 books during the summer sale. How much money did they generate from selling the books during the winter sale?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we determine how many books were sold during the winter sale. Since a total of 200 books were sold during both sales and 150 were sold in the summer sale, we subtract the summer sales from the total sales: 200 - 150 = 50 books sold in the winter sale. Next, we calculate the profit generated from these 50 books. The profit per book sold is $25, so we multiply the number of winter sale books by the profit per book: 50 books * $25/book = $1250. Therefore, the total money generated from selling the books during the winter sale is $1250.\nTherefore, the answer is (1250)\n\nQ: Lisa started with 10 books on her desk. Then she added some more books and took away 5 of the old ones.

After adding these books, she took away 5 books. The number of books on her desk can be calculated as: 10 + x - 5. We know this total equals 12 books. Now we can set up the equation: 10 + x - 5 = 12. Simplifying this, we have: 5 + x = 12. Therefore, to find x, we subtract 5 from both sides: x = 12 - 5, which gives us x = 7. So, Lisa added 7 books to her desk.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Sophia had 55 dollars in her wallet. She got 45 more dollars after selling some old items. After shopping for books, she was left with 20 dollars. How much more money did she spend on books than she earned from selling items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSophia started with 55 dollars. After selling some items, she earned an additional 45 dollars. Therefore, the total amount of money Sophia had after selling her items is 55 + 45 = 100 dollars. After shopping for books, she was left with 20 dollars. To find out how much money she spent on books, we subtract her remaining money from her total: 100 - 20 = 80 dollars. She spent 80 dollars on books. Next, we need to find out how much more she spent on books than she earned from selling items. She earned 45 dollars from selling items. Therefore, the difference between what she spent on books and what she earned from selling items is 80 - 45 = 35 dollars.

The information given states that 45 buckets are harvested per day. Next, we need to find out how many buckets will be harvested over a span of 15 days. To do this, we multiply the daily collection by the number of days: 45 buckets/day * 15 days = 675 buckets. Therefore, the total number of buckets of tomatoes collected after 15 days is 675.\nTherefore, the answer is (675)\n\nQ: An orchard keeper had 250 peaches on his farm. If he picked 80 of them yesterday and 45 today. How many did he have left after yesterday's picking?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe orchard keeper started with 250 peaches.

So, we calculate: 250 - 80 = 170 peaches left after yesterday's picking.\nTherefore, the answer is (170)\n\nQ: A rancher had 120 strawberries in his field. If he picked 50 of them yesterday and 36 today. How many did he have left after yesterday's picking?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe rancher initially had 120 strawberries. After picking 50 strawberries yesterday, we need to subtract those from the initial amount to find out how many strawberries were left. This can be calculated as follows: 120 - 50 = 70. Therefore, after yesterday's picking, the rancher had 70 strawberries left.\nTherefore, the answer is (70)\n\nQ: Being her favorite, he saved assessing the vineyard for the last task. He was told by 160 of the workers that they collect 50 baskets of grapes in 2 days. How many baskets of grapes would be collected in each day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many baskets of grapes are collected in each day, we need to divide the total number of baskets by the total number of days. We are told that the workers collect 50 baskets of grapes in 2 days. Thus, we can calculate the daily collection by performing the calculation: 50 baskets / 2 days = 25 baskets per day. Therefore, each day they collect 25 baskets.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: He then went to see the bananas being collected. He found out that they harvest 70 loads per day and that each load contains 25 bananas. How many bananas are collected if they harvest a total of 35 loads of bananas?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many bananas are collected when harvesting 35 loads, we first need to determine how many bananas are in each load. Given that each load contains 25 bananas, we can calculate the total number of bananas collected from 35 loads by multiplying the number of loads by the number of bananas per load. Thus, the calculation is: 35 loads * 25 bananas/load = 875 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas collected is 875.\nTherefore, the answer is (875)\n\nQ: A farmer owned 150 apples in his orchard. If he collected 45 of them yesterday and 30 today. How many did he have remaining after yesterday's collection?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe farmer initially had 150 apples. After collecting 45 apples yesterday, we subtract the number of apples collected from the initial total. This gives us 150 - 45 = 105 apples remaining after yesterday's collection.\nTherefore, the answer is (105)\n\nQ: He then went to see the grapes being picked. He found out that they gather 80 baskets per day and that each basket contains 20 grapes. How many grapes are picked if they gather a total of 40 baskets of grapes?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of grapes picked when 40 baskets are gathered, we first need to know how many grapes are in one basket. According to the information provided, each basket contains 20 grapes. So, the total number of grapes can be calculated by multiplying the number of baskets (40) by the number of grapes in each basket (20). This gives us the equation: 40 baskets * 20 grapes/basket = 800 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes picked is 800.\nTherefore, the answer is (800)\n\nQ: A cultivator had 400 potatoes in his field. If he collected 120 of them yesterday and 90 today.

{"prompt": "Q: After relishing a rich dessert, they opted to take a tour of the Taj Mahal. There, Jack noted that 420 patrons visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 380 patrons the previous day and 500 patrons the day before that. How many visited the Taj Mahal within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many patrons visited the Taj Mahal in the past 89 days, we need to compute the total based on the given visits for the last three days and estimate for the previous days. We have the following information: 500 patrons two days ago, 380 patrons one day ago, and 420 patrons today. We can average the number of patrons or assume a similar pattern continues across the previous days to extrapolate a rough estimate. It would be reasonable to calculate an average based on these three days: (500 + 380 + 420) / 3 = 433.33. We can round this number to 433 for simplicity. Now, if we assume that this average holds for each of the 89 days, we calculate the total by multiplying: 433 patrons/day * 89 days = 38,557 patrons. Therefore, the total number of patrons who visited the Taj Mahal over the past 89 days is approximately 38,557.\nTherefore, the answer is (38557)\n\nQ: After enjoying a satisfying brunch, they decided to explore the Tower of London. There, John found out that 90 visitors visited the Tower on the previous day. If 2,400 people came to the Tower in the last 40 days, how many visitors were there that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many visitors were there that day, we first need to find the average number of visitors per day over the last 40 days. We can do this by dividing the total number of visitors by the number of days. The total number of visitors over the last 40 days is 2,400. Thus, we calculate 2400 visitors / 40 days = 60 visitors per day on average. Now, we know that 90 visitors visited the Tower the previous day. Since this number (90) is higher than the average (60), we conclude that the number of visitors on that day is simply 90. Therefore, we do not need any further calculations regarding variation, and we state the conclusion clearly.\nTherefore, the answer is (90)\n\nQ: After enjoying a delightful lunch, they visited the Eiffel Tower. There, Sarah realized that 412 tourists arrived at the Eiffel Tower that day. If there were 391 tourists the previous day and 678 tourists the day before that. How many visited the Eiffel Tower within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of tourists who visited the Eiffel Tower within the past 89 days, we can analyze the provided data. We know the number of tourists for the last three days: 412 for today, 391 for the previous day, and 678 for the day before that. We don't have specific data for the other 86 days. However, we can calculate the total for the three days we have and denote the remaining 86 days as an unknown. \n\nFirst, we need to sum the tourists from the three known days: \n412 (today) + 391 (yesterday) + 678 (day before yesterday) = 1481 tourists for these three days. \n\nSince we lack exact data for the remaining days, we cannot provide a precise number for the entire 89-day period. Generally, historical average values or trends could be considered for an accurate estimate, but those are not provided in this case. Therefore, the total number of visitors over the past 89 days remains undetermined with the given information. \n\nThus, under these circumstances, we can only present the total of the currently known days, which is 1481 tourists.\nTherefore, the answer is (1481)\n\nQ: After a satisfying meal, they ventured to admire the Taj Mahal. There were 1000 workers involved in building the Taj Mahal. There, Ava found out that 654 visitors visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 220 visitors the previous day. How many visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors who visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days, we first note the visitor counts for the specific days mentioned. For the current day, 654 visitors were recorded. For the previous day, there were 220 visitors. Assuming that these two days are part of the 70-day period, we need to estimate the average number of visitors over these 70 days. If we take both these days into account, we would have 654 + 220 = 874 visitors over these two days. This gives us an average of 874 visitors / 2 days = 437 visitors per day for these two days. To find the estimated total visitors over 70 days, we can multiply the average daily count by the total number of days: 437 visitors/day * 70 days = 30,590 visitors. We can assume that the visitor numbers remain relatively consistent each day of the period being analyzed. Therefore, the estimated total number of visitors to the Taj Mahal within 70 days is around 30,590.\nTherefore, the answer is (30590)\n\nQ: Following a refreshing afternoon snack, they made their way to the Eiffel Tower. There, Emma found out that 80 visitors explored the Eiffel Tower the day before. If 2,300 people visited the Eiffel Tower in the last 30 days, how many visitors were there on that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the number of visitors to the Eiffel Tower on the specific day mentioned, we first note that 2,300 people visited over the last 30 days. We can find the average number of visitors per day by dividing the total number of visitors by the number of days: 2,300 visitors / 30 days = 76.67 visitors/day. Next, we are given that 80 visitors explored the Eiffel Tower the day before the specific day being analyzed. We can then assume that the visitation trend might mean that the number of visitors could vary slightly from day to day. However, for the day in question, since no specific information about a change in visitor numbers is given, we can take the number of visitors from the previous day as a reliable estimate for that day, which is 80 visitors. Therefore, the answer is (80).\nTherefore, the answer is (80)\n\nQ: After finishing a fabulous brunch, they decided to tour the Palace of Versailles. There, Emily discovered that 180 guests visited the Palace that day. If 600 visitors had toured the Palace in the past 100 days, how many came the day before?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many visitors came the day before, we first need to determine the average number of visitors per day over the past 100 days. We can calculate the average by dividing the total number of visitors (600) by the number of days (100). This gives us an average of 600 / 100 = 6 visitors per day. On the day we are interested in, there were 180 visitors. This means that the previous day's visitors must be accounted for in such a way that the additional 180 visitors did not significantly alter the average, given that the average remains low. Since we are only interested in the calculation for the day before the day with 180 visitors, we assume the count was about the average value. Therefore, the number of visitors the day before, based on our assumption, is approximately equal to the average, which is 6. Thus, we conclude that 6 visitors came the day before.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: After a delightful lunch, they made their way to the aquarium. At the aquarium, Sarah found out that 85 people came to explore that day. The previous day, 250 visitors were recorded, and the day before that saw 130 visitors. How many visited the aquarium before that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe need to find out how many visitors came to the aquarium before the previous day. We already know the visitor counts for the last three days: 85 today, 250 yesterday, and 130 the day before yesterday. To find the number of visitors before these three days, we should consider the data given that only specifies visitors for three consecutive days, and no data is given for the day prior to these three days. Therefore, we don't have enough information to determine the exact number of visitors before these three recorded days.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (unknown).)\n\nQ: After enjoying a delightful breakfast, they decided to visit the Tower of London. There, Sarah discovered that 150 tourists had visited the Tower the day before. If there were 800 visitors on that day, how many more visitors came to the Tower that day than the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many more visitors came to the Tower on the day in question compared to the previous day, we start with the number of visitors on that day, which is 800. Next, we note the number of visitors from the previous day, which is 150. To find the difference, we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day: 800 - 150 = 650. Therefore, the number of additional visitors on that day compared to the previous day is 650.\nTherefore, the answer is (650)\n\nQuestion: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace.

{"prompt": "Q: Nathan earns $ 620 every week during the 65 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 300 rent every week, how much money will he have at the end of the harvest season?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate Nathan's total earnings over the 65 weeks of harvest. He earns $620 each week, so we multiply his weekly earnings by the total number of weeks: 620 * 65 = 40300. Next, we calculate Nathan's total rent expenses for the 65 weeks. He pays $300 in rent each week, so we multiply his weekly rent by the total number of weeks: 300 * 65 = 19500.

If she has to pay $ 80 rent every week. How much money does she earn during harvest season?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate how much Sophie earns during the harvest season, we first find her total earnings without considering expenses. Sophie earns $700 every week for 250 weeks. Therefore, her total earnings are calculated as follows: 700 * 250 = 175000. Next, we need to account for her rent expenses. Sophie pays $80 rent every week for 250 weeks. Her total rent expenses are calculated as follows: 80 * 250 = 20000. Finally, we subtract her total rent expenses from her total earnings to find out her net earnings: 175000 - 20000 = 155000.

The next day, she picked some more vases and ended up with a total of 12 vases. To find out how many vases she picked the next day, we can set up the equation: 8 (initial vases) + x (vases picked on the next day) = 12 (total vases). Solving for x gives us: x = 12 - 8, which simplifies to x = 4. Therefore, she picked 4 vases on the next day.\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQ: Sarah collects postcards.

Emily tossed out 2 sunflowers from the vase and picked more sunflowers from her garden to add to the vase. There are now 6 sunflowers in the vase. How many more sunflowers did she pick than those she tossed out?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there are 5 sunflowers in the vase. Emily tossed out 2 sunflowers, which reduces the number of sunflowers in the vase to 5 - 2 = 3. She then adds more sunflowers from her garden, resulting in a total of 6 sunflowers in the vase now. Therefore, the number of sunflowers she added is 6 - 3 = 3. Now we need to find out how many more sunflowers she picked than those she tossed out. She tossed out 2 sunflowers and picked 3, so the difference is 3 - 2 = 1. Thus, she picked 1 more sunflower than the amount she tossed out.\nTherefore, the answer is (1)\n\nQ: Initially, there were 20 sunflowers and 12 lilies in the bouquet.

Mark picked extra flowers, and now the bouquet contains 25 lilies and 8 sunflowers. We need to find out how many more lilies than sunflowers there are in the bouquet now. The number of lilies is 25, and the number of sunflowers is 8. Therefore, to find the difference, we subtract the number of sunflowers from the number of lilies: 25 (lilies) - 8 (sunflowers) = 17. Thus, there are 17 more lilies than sunflowers in the bouquet now.\nTherefore, the answer is (17)\n\nQ: There were 12 carnation flowers in the jar. Lucas took some more carnations from his garden which had a total of 15 carnations. There are now 27 carnations in the jar. How many carnations are left in the garden?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 12 carnations in the jar. Lucas took some more from his garden, which had a total of 15 carnations. After adding the carnations from his garden to the jar, the total number of carnations in the jar became 27. To find out how many carnations Lucas took from the garden, we can set up the equation: 12 (initial) + x (flowers taken) = 27 (total after taking). Solving for x gives us x = 27 - 12 = 15. Thus, Lucas took all 15 from his garden. Since he started with 15 in the garden and took all of them, there are now 15 - 15 = 0 left in the garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: There were 14 gardenias in the pot. Laura threw away 6 gardenias from the pot and cut some fresh gardenias from her garden to put in the pot. There are now 12 gardenias in the pot.

She then adds some fresh gardenias. The total in the pot is now 12 gardenias. To find out how many fresh gardenias she cut, we calculate 12 - 8 = 4. Thus, Laura cut 4 fresh gardenias. Now, we need to find how many more gardenias she cut than those she threw away. She threw away 6 gardenias and cut 4 gardenias, so 4 - 6 = -2, which means she cut 2 fewer gardenias than she threw away.\nTherefore, the answer is (-2)\n\nQ: There were 30 lilies in the vase. James threw away 15 lilies from the vase and trimmed some new lilies from his patch to place in the vase. There are now 20 lilies in the vase. How many more lilies did he trim than those he threw away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 30 lilies in the vase. James threw away 15 lilies, so the number of lilies remaining was 30 - 15 = 15 lilies. After trimming and adding new lilies, there are now 20 lilies in the vase. This means that James must have added 20 - 15 = 5 new lilies. The number of lilies he trimmed is 5, and the number of lilies he threw away is 15. To find how many more lilies he trimmed than those he threw away, we subtract the number he threw away from the number he trimmed: 5 - 15 = -10. Therefore, he did not trim more lilies than he threw away; he actually trimmed 10 fewer lilies than he threw away.\nTherefore, the answer is (10)\n\nQuestion: There were 21 roses in the vase.

{"prompt": "Q: Nathan earns $ 620 every week during the 65 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 300 rent every week, how much money will he have at the end of the harvest season?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to calculate Nathan's total earnings over the 65 weeks of harvest. He earns $620 each week, so we multiply his weekly earnings by the total number of weeks: 620 * 65 = 40300. Next, we calculate Nathan's total rent expenses for the 65 weeks. He pays $300 in rent each week, so we multiply his weekly rent by the total number of weeks: 300 * 65 = 19500. Finally, to find out how much money Nathan has at the end of the harvest season, we subtract his total rent expenses from his total earnings: 40300 - 19500 = 20800.\nTherefore, the answer is (20800)\n\nQ: Sophie earns $ 700 every week during the 250 weeks of harvest. If she has to pay $ 80 rent every week. How much money does she earn during harvest season?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate how much Sophie earns during the harvest season, we first find her total earnings without considering expenses. Sophie earns $700 every week for 250 weeks. Therefore, her total earnings are calculated as follows: 700 * 250 = 175000. Next, we need to account for her rent expenses. Sophie pays $80 rent every week for 250 weeks. Her total rent expenses are calculated as follows: 80 * 250 = 20000. Finally, we subtract her total rent expenses from her total earnings to find out her net earnings: 175000 - 20000 = 155000. Therefore, the answer is (155000).\nTherefore, the answer is (155000)\n\nQ: Olivia makes $40 weekly during her 1005 weeks of work. She additionally earns $1,200 each week for her overtime. If she always works overtime, how much then does she earn for the entire work period?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate Olivia's regular weekly earnings which is $40. Over 1005 weeks, her total earnings from regular hours is 40 * 1005. Next, we calculate her overtime weekly earnings of $1200. Over the same 1005 weeks, her total earnings from overtime is 1200 * 1005. Finally, we add the two totals together to find her total earnings for the entire work period.\nTherefore, the answer is (1242000)\n\nQ: Alex earns $ 300 every week during the 120 weeks of fall. If he has to pay $ 40 rent every week. How much money does he earn during fall season?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total earnings over the 120 weeks by multiplying the weekly earnings by the number of weeks. Alex earns $300 every week, so for 120 weeks, it would be 300 * 120 = 36000. Next, calculate the total rent he needs to pay over these 120 weeks by multiplying the weekly rent of $40 by the number of weeks. This amounts to 40 * 120 = 4800. Finally, subtract the total rent from the total earnings to find the net earnings: 36000 - 4800 = 31200. Therefore, the net earnings during the fall season is $31,200.\nTherefore, the answer is (31200)\n\nQ: David has a weekly income of $27 for 1085 weeks of employment. Furthermore, he earns $1,050 for every week he works overtime. If he puts in overtime every week, what is his total earnings during his employment?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nDavid earns a weekly income of $27 for 1085 weeks. To calculate his total earnings from his regular income, we multiply his weekly income by the total number of weeks: 27 * 1085. Additionally, David earns $1,050 for every week he works overtime, and since he puts in overtime every week for the same number of weeks, this adds another income stream. Thus, we calculate the overtime earnings by multiplying $1,050 by the total number of weeks: 1,050 * 1085. Finally, we sum both the regular earnings and the overtime earnings to find the total earnings during his employment.\nTherefore, the answer is (1162350)\n\nQ: Emily earns $ 550 every week during the 78 weeks of planting.

First, we calculate her total earnings during the planting season: total earnings = weekly earnings * number of weeks = 550 * 78. Next, we calculate her total rent expenses during the same period: total rent = weekly rent * number of weeks = 250 * 78. Finally, we subtract her total rent expenses from her total earnings to find out how much money she will have at the end of the planting season.\nTherefore, the answer is (22100)\n\nQ: Daniel gets $26 weekly during his 1150 weeks of service. He also earns $1,150 each week for overtime work. If he works overtime every week, what is his total earning for those weeks?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we calculate Daniel's weekly earnings from regular work, which is $26 per week. Over 1150 weeks, the total from regular work would be 26 * 1150 = 29900 dollars. Next, we calculate his overtime earnings, which is $1150 each week. Over 1150 weeks, the total from overtime would be 1150 * 1150 = 1322500 dollars. Now, we add both totals to get his overall earnings: 29900 + 1322500 = 1352400 dollars. Therefore, the total earnings for those weeks is 1352400 dollars.\nTherefore, the answer is (1352400)\n\nQ: Ben receives $32 weekly during his 1120 weeks of harvest. He also makes $980 per week for overtime hours.

Ben receives $32 weekly from his harvest work and also earns $980 per week from overtime. Hence, his total weekly earnings can be calculated by adding these two amounts together: $32 + $980 = $1012. Now, since he works for 1120 weeks during the harvest, we can calculate his total earnings by multiplying his total weekly earnings by the number of weeks: $1012 * 1120 weeks = $1,134,640. Therefore, his earnings during the harvest season amount to $1,134,640.\nTherefore, the answer is (1134640)\n\nQuestion: If Lewis earns $ 1357 every week during the 223 weeks of a harvest season.

He received an additional 90 dollars from his parents. To find out how much money he had after receiving the money from his parents, we add these amounts: 60 + 90 = 150 dollars. After going to the movies, he had 85 dollars left. To determine how much he spent, we subtract the amount left from the total amount he had before going to the movies: 150 - 85 = 65 dollars.

Now he has $5. How much did Michael have before he spent his money?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMichael spent $30 to buy 150 marbles. To determine how much money Michael had before spending, we first recognize that after spending, he has $5 left. Therefore, before spending money, Michael's total amount was the amount he spent plus what remains. Thus, we calculate: Amount before spending = Amount spent + Amount remaining = $30 + $5 = $35. Hence, Michael had $35 before he spent his money.\nTherefore, the answer is (35)\n\nQ: For Alex's birthday he received some dollars. He spent 5 dollars and has 10 dollars left with him.

About how many kids are in Springfield?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of kids in Springfield, we need to add the number of kids attending skiing lessons to the number of kids staying home. There are 450321 kids who go to skiing lessons and 378940 kids who stay home. We also have 15 kids from outside the city who attended the lessons, but since we are only concerned with the number of kids in Springfield, we do not count these. We proceed with the addition: 450321 + 378940 = 829261. Thus, the total number of kids in Springfield is 829261.\nTherefore, the answer is (829261)\n\nQ: During the break, 350000 kids from Lakeside go to a summer camp and another 750000 kids remain at home. How many more kids stayed home than those who attended the summer camp?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many kids stayed home and how many attended the summer camp. We know that 350,000 kids went to the summer camp, and 750,000 kids stayed at home. Next, we find the difference between the number of kids who stayed home and those who attended the camp. We calculate this by subtracting the number of kids at the camp from the number of kids at home: 750,000 - 350,000. This gives us 400,000 kids. Thus, there are 400,000 more kids that stayed home than those who attended the summer camp.\nTherefore, the answer is (400000)\n\nQ: Over spring break, 310456 kids from Riverdale go to art workshops while the other 270123 kids stay home. An additional 18 kids from other states joined the workshops. About how many kids are in Riverdale?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of kids in Riverdale, we need to add the kids attending the art workshops and those staying home, along with the additional kids from other states. The calculation is as follows: First, add the number of kids attending workshops (310456) to the number of kids staying home (270123). This gives us 310456 + 270123 = 580579. Next, we add the additional kids from other states (18) to this total: 580579 + 18 = 580597.

An additional 16 kids from other towns participated in the classes. About how many kids are in Westfield?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many kids are in Westfield, we need to add the number of kids in dance classes and the number of kids who are at home. The total number of kids who went to dance classes from Westfield is 512345, and the number who remain at home is 458678. We simply add these two numbers: 512345 + 458678 = 971023. This sum represents the total number of kids in Westfield. Therefore, the number of kids in Westfield is roughly 971023.\nTherefore, the answer is (971023)\n\nQ: During the summer session, 720045 kids from Greenville go to music camp and the other 634562 kids remain at home. An additional 12 kids from nearby areas attended the camp. About how many kids are in Greenville?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of kids in Greenville, we need to account for both those who attended music camp and those who stayed at home. We know that 720045 kids went to camp, and 634562 kids remained at home. We will add these two numbers to find the total number of kids in Greenville before considering the additional kids from nearby areas. Additionally, we have 12 kids from nearby areas attending the camp, but since we are only concentrating on the number of kids from Greenville, we will not include these 12 kids in our total calculation. Now, let's perform the addition: 720045 (kids at camp) + 634562 (kids at home) = 1350607. Therefore, the total number of kids in Greenville is 1350607.\nTherefore, the answer is (1350607)\n\nQ: During spring break 550876 kids from Green County stayed home and the other 789200 kids went to art camp.

{"prompt": "Q: Nina had some dolls in her toy basket. Later she added 9 more dolls to the basket and removed 11 of the old ones. If there are 3 dolls in her toy basket now, how many dolls did Nina have initially in the basket?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the initial number of dolls Nina had be x. After adding 9 more dolls, the total number becomes x + 9. Then, she removed 11 dolls from this total, which gives us (x + 9 - 11). Simplifying that, we have x - 2. According to the problem, this total equals 3 dolls, so we set up the equation: x - 2 = 3. Solving for x, we add 2 to both sides, giving us x = 5. Therefore, Nina initially had 5 dolls in her toy basket.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: David was saving coins for a fundraiser. On Sunday he had a few piggy banks of coins. The next day he found 5 more piggy banks worth of coins. If he had a total of 11 piggy banks altogether, how many piggy banks did he have on Sunday?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet's denote the number of piggy banks David had on Sunday as x. According to the problem, the next day he found 5 more piggy banks. Therefore, the total number of piggy banks he had after finding the additional banks is x + 5. We know that this total is equal to 11 piggy banks. Thus, we can set up the following equation: x + 5 = 11. To find x, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: x = 11 - 5, which simplifies to x = 6. Therefore, David had 6 piggy banks on Sunday.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: Alice kept 9 dolls in her collection. She added several more dolls to her collection but sold 4 of the old ones. If she has 11 dolls now, how many dolls did she add?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nAlice initially had 9 dolls. She then added some dolls to her collection, which we will denote as 'x'. After adding these dolls, she sold 4 of the old dolls. After these transactions, she ended up with 11 dolls. We can express this situation with the following equation: 9 + x - 4 = 11. Simplifying the equation gives us: 9 + x - 4 = 11 <=> x + 5 = 11 <=> x = 11 - 5 <=> x = 6. Therefore, she added 6 dolls to her collection.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: Mia was helping her teacher divide 8 packs of crayons among students. They had 64 crayons in total. If they distributed the same number of crayons to each student, how many crayons did each student get?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know there are 64 crayons in total. Mia and her teacher need to distribute these crayons equally among the students. To find out how many crayons each student gets, we first need to know how many students there are. Since they are dividing 8 packs of crayons, we will assume each pack contains an equal number of crayons. Given that there are 8 packs and 64 crayons in total, we can divide the total number of crayons by the number of packs to find out how many crayons are in each pack. There are 64 crayons and 8 packs, so we calculate 64 divided by 8, which gives us 8 crayons per pack. If Mia and the teacher distribute the crayons equally among the students, and if they distribute 8 crayons per pack without knowing the specific number of students initially, we can conclude each student gets 8 crayons assuming there is one student per pack. Thus, each student will receive 8 crayons. Therefore, the answer is (8).\nTherefore, the answer is (8)\n\nQ: Sara was collecting toys for charity. On Saturday she had several bags of toys. The next day, she discovered 5 more bags worth of toys. If she had a total of 12 bags altogether, how many bags did she have on Saturday?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet's denote the number of bags Sara had on Saturday as x. According to the problem, the next day, she discovered 5 more bags. This can be expressed as: x + 5 = 12. Now, we can solve for x: x = 12 - 5, which gives us x = 7. Therefore, Sara had 7 bags of toys on Saturday.\nTherefore, the answer is (7)\n\nQ: Olivia was laying out her cupcakes into trays with 5 cupcakes in each tray. She baked 40 batches of cupcakes, with each batch yielding 12 cupcakes. How many trays could she organize?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, determine the total number of cupcakes Olivia baked. She baked 40 batches with each batch yielding 12 cupcakes. Therefore, the total number of cupcakes is 40 batches * 12 cupcakes/batch = 480 cupcakes. Next, since she organizes them into trays with 5 cupcakes each, divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per tray. So, 480 cupcakes / 5 cupcakes/tray = 96 trays. Therefore, the total number of trays she could organize is 96.\nTherefore, the answer is (96)\n\nQ: Michael was preparing boxes for shipping. On Tuesday he had 6 containers of products. The next day he acquired some more containers of products. If he had a total of 11 containers altogether, how many containers did he acquire on the next day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMichael started with 6 containers on Tuesday. The next day, he acquired more containers, and the total number of containers he had became 11. To find out how many containers he acquired, we can set up the equation: 6 (original containers) + x (containers acquired) = 11 (total containers). To isolate x, we subtract 6 from both sides: x = 11 - 6. Therefore, x = 5. Thus, he acquired 5 additional containers.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Max owns 10 baskets of eggs, with each basket containing 12 eggs.

Initially, there were 18 orchids and 8 lilies in the vase. 2. After cutting more from his garden, there are now 23 orchids and 9 lilies in the vase. 3. To find out how many orchids were cut, calculate the difference: 23 (current) - 18 (initial) = 5 orchids cut. 4. To find out how many lilies were cut, calculate the difference: 9 (current) - 8 (initial) = 1 lily cut. 5. Therefore, Robert cut 1 lily from his garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (1)\n\nQ: Maria had 7 plants in her garden. Later she added 5 more plants to the garden and removed some of the old ones. If there are 9 plants in her garden now, how many plants did she remove from the garden?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMaria initially had 7 plants. She then added 5 more plants, making the total number of plants 7 + 5 = 12. Now, there are only 9 plants left in the garden. To find out how many plants she removed, we subtract the current number of plants from the total number she had after the addition: 12 - 9 = 3. Therefore, Maria removed 3 plants from her garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: Spring is coming and a lot of butterflies are migrating to greener areas. There were 65 butterfly species in the garden. If 10 butterfly species flew away for spring, how many more butterfly species stayed than those that flew away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nStart with the total number of butterfly species in the garden, which is 65. If 10 butterfly species flew away, we need to calculate how many species remained in the garden. To find this, subtract the number of species that flew away from the total: 65 - 10 = 55. Now, to find out how many more species stayed than those that flew away, we calculate the difference between the number of species that stayed (55) and those that flew away (10): 55 - 10 = 45. Therefore, there are 45 more butterfly species that stayed than those that flew away.\nTherefore, the answer is (45)\n\nQ: There were 14 gardenias in the pot. Laura threw away 6 gardenias from the pot and cut some fresh gardenias from her garden to put in the pot. There are now 12 gardenias in the pot. How many more gardenias did she cut than those she threw away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nStart with 14 gardenias in the pot. Laura throws away 6 gardenias, leaving 14 - 6 = 8 gardenias. She then adds some fresh gardenias. The total in the pot is now 12 gardenias. To find out how many fresh gardenias she cut, we calculate 12 - 8 = 4. Thus, Laura cut 4 fresh gardenias. Now, we need to find how many more gardenias she cut than those she threw away. She threw away 6 gardenias and cut 4 gardenias, so 4 - 6 = -2, which means she cut 2 fewer gardenias than she threw away.\nTherefore, the answer is (-2)\n\nQ: There were 6 orchids in the display. David picked some more orchids from his greenhouse which had a total of 36 orchids. There are now 22 orchids in the display. How many orchids did he pick?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 6 orchids in the display. After David picked some more orchids, the total in the display became 22. To find out how many orchids David picked, we can subtract the initial number of orchids from the final number: 22 - 6 = 16. Therefore, David picked 16 orchids.\nTherefore, the answer is (16)\n\nQ: Lucy the florist and her crew are getting ready for a wedding at Lucy's shop. Lucy arranged 150 roses and 400 tulips a few days ago. And she arranged 350 tulips and 130 roses yesterday. How many more tulips did Lucy arrange a few days ago compared to yesterday?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find the number of tulips Lucy arranged a few days ago. According to the information given, she arranged 400 tulips a few days ago. Next, we find out how many tulips she arranged yesterday, which is 350 tulips. Now, we will calculate the difference in the number of tulips arranged between the two days by subtracting the number of tulips arranged yesterday from the number arranged a few days ago. So, we calculate 400 tulips (a few days ago) - 350 tulips (yesterday) = 50 tulips. Therefore, Lucy arranged 50 more tulips a few days ago compared to yesterday.\nTherefore, the answer is (50)\n\nQ: There were 40 orchids in the arrangement. David got rid of 10 orchids from the arrangement and harvested some new orchids from his greenhouse to put in the arrangement. There are now 35 orchids in the arrangement. How many more orchids did he harvest than those he got rid of?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 40 orchids in the arrangement. David removed 10 orchids. So, the number of orchids left after removal is 40 - 10 = 30 orchids. David then added new orchids to the arrangement, and now there are 35 orchids in total. To find out how many new orchids were added, we set up the equation: 30 + x = 35, where x is the number of new orchids. Solving for x gives us x = 35 - 30 = 5. Thus, David harvested 5 new orchids. Now, to determine how many more orchids he harvested than the orchids he got rid of, we calculate: 5 (new orchids) - 10 (orchids removed) = -5. Since we are asked how many more he harvested than he got rid of, we report it as a negative value indicating he harvested fewer. Therefore, the answer is (-5).\nTherefore, the answer is (-5)\n\nQuestion: There were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden.

{"prompt": "Q: After enjoying a delicious lunch, they decided to visit the Eiffel Tower. There, Sarah discovered that 890 visitors had toured the Eiffel Tower that day. If there were 245 visitors the previous day and 671 visitors the day before that. How many more visitors explored the Eiffel Tower on that day than on the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many more visitors explored the Eiffel Tower on that day (890 visitors) than on the previous day (245 visitors), we will calculate the difference between these two values. We subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day: 890 - 245 = 645. Therefore, 645 more visitors explored the Eiffel Tower on that day than on the previous day.\nTherefore, the answer is (645)\n\nQ: After indulging in a sumptuous brunch, they set off to see the Statue of Liberty. There, Mia learned that 980 visitors had seen the statue that day. If the previous day had 280 visitors and the day before that saw 745 visitors. How many more visitors came to the Statue of Liberty on that day compared to the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more visitors came to the Statue of Liberty on the day Mia visited compared to the previous two days, we first need to look at the visitor numbers for each of the three days: 980 (the day Mia visited), 280 (the previous day), and 745 (the day before that). Next, we calculate the total number of visitors for the two previous days: 280 + 745 = 1025. Now, we subtract the total number of visitors from the day Mia visited (980) from the total visitors of the two previous days (1025): 1025 - 980 = 45. This means that there were 45 more visitors across the two previous days than on the day Mia visited.\nTherefore, the answer is (45)\n\nQ: After relishing a lovely lunch, they stopped by the Tower of London. There were 5 towers in the Tower of London. There, Tom learned that 620 visitors toured the Tower of London that day. If the day before had 590 visitors, how many more visitors visited the Tower of London that day than on the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many more visitors visited the Tower of London that day compared to the previous day, we need to subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the number of visitors that day. So we take the number of visitors on the recent day, which is 620, and subtract the number of visitors from the previous day, which is 590. This can be expressed as follows: 620 - 590 = 30. Thus, there were 30 more visitors that day than the day before.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\nQ: Following a refreshing afternoon snack, they made their way to the Eiffel Tower. There, Emma found out that 80 visitors explored the Eiffel Tower the day before. If 2,300 people visited the Eiffel Tower in the last 30 days, how many visitors were there on that day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine the number of visitors to the Eiffel Tower on the specific day mentioned, we first note that 2,300 people visited over the last 30 days. We can find the average number of visitors per day by dividing the total number of visitors by the number of days: 2,300 visitors / 30 days = 76.67 visitors/day. Next, we are given that 80 visitors explored the Eiffel Tower the day before the specific day being analyzed. We can then assume that the visitation trend might mean that the number of visitors could vary slightly from day to day. However, for the day in question, since no specific information about a change in visitor numbers is given, we can take the number of visitors from the previous day as a reliable estimate for that day, which is 80 visitors. Therefore, the answer is (80).\nTherefore, the answer is (80)\n\nQ: After a satisfying meal, they ventured to admire the Taj Mahal. There were 1000 workers involved in building the Taj Mahal. There, Ava found out that 654 visitors visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 220 visitors the previous day. How many visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of visitors who visited the Taj Mahal within 70 days, we first note the visitor counts for the specific days mentioned. For the current day, 654 visitors were recorded. For the previous day, there were 220 visitors. Assuming that these two days are part of the 70-day period, we need to estimate the average number of visitors over these 70 days. If we take both these days into account, we would have 654 + 220 = 874 visitors over these two days. This gives us an average of 874 visitors / 2 days = 437 visitors per day for these two days. To find the estimated total visitors over 70 days, we can multiply the average daily count by the total number of days: 437 visitors/day * 70 days = 30,590 visitors. We can assume that the visitor numbers remain relatively consistent each day of the period being analyzed. Therefore, the estimated total number of visitors to the Taj Mahal within 70 days is around 30,590.\nTherefore, the answer is (30590)\n\nQ: After relishing a rich dessert, they opted to take a tour of the Taj Mahal. There, Jack noted that 420 patrons visited the Taj Mahal that day. If there were 380 patrons the previous day and 500 patrons the day before that. How many visited the Taj Mahal within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many patrons visited the Taj Mahal in the past 89 days, we need to compute the total based on the given visits for the last three days and estimate for the previous days. We have the following information: 500 patrons two days ago, 380 patrons one day ago, and 420 patrons today. We can average the number of patrons or assume a similar pattern continues across the previous days to extrapolate a rough estimate. It would be reasonable to calculate an average based on these three days: (500 + 380 + 420) / 3 = 433.33. We can round this number to 433 for simplicity. Now, if we assume that this average holds for each of the 89 days, we calculate the total by multiplying: 433 patrons/day * 89 days = 38,557 patrons. Therefore, the total number of patrons who visited the Taj Mahal over the past 89 days is approximately 38,557.\nTherefore, the answer is (38557)\n\nQ: After having a memorable meal, they proceeded to explore the Tower of London. There, Jake discovered that 425 visitors toured the Tower that day. The day before had 112 visitors, and the day prior to that had 397 visitors. What is the difference in visitor count for that day compared to the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the difference in visitor count for the day Jake visited the Tower of London compared to the previous 245 days, we first need to consider only the visitor counts from the last three days provided. The counts are as follows: 425 visitors (the day Jake visited), 112 visitors (the previous day), and 397 visitors (the day before that). There are no additional visitor counts provided for the previous 245 days, so we would assume they are irrelevant to the calculation of the difference. The significant data point is the count of 425 visitors on the day Jake visited, as it stands alone without comparison to any specific number from those 245 days. Therefore, we cannot determine a specific difference since we do not have a defined average or total visitor count for the previous 245 days. Thus, we can only provide the difference in counts among the known values. The average visitor count of these three days is (425 + 112 + 397) / 3 = 311.33, and comparing the latest day of 425 visitors versus this average shows there were 113.67 more visitors than the average. Since the question asks for the difference and the previous 245 days' data is not specified, we'll treat the average as a reference point without calculating it as a historic average since that data isn't provided. Hence the difference from the average would be 113.67, but as asked for the problem, we cannot truly assess the 245 previous days directly. Therefore, I conclude that more context is necessary to provide a definitive count relative to the past period.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (113.67).)\n\nQ: After enjoying a delightful breakfast, they decided to visit the Tower of London. There, Sarah discovered that 150 tourists had visited the Tower the day before. If there were 800 visitors on that day, how many more visitors came to the Tower that day than the previous day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many more visitors came to the Tower on the day in question compared to the previous day, we start with the number of visitors on that day, which is 800. Next, we note the number of visitors from the previous day, which is 150. To find the difference, we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day: 800 - 150 = 650. Therefore, the number of additional visitors on that day compared to the previous day is 650.\nTherefore, the answer is (650)\n\nQuestion: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace.

How far is the exit of the tunnel?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how far it is from the end of the tunnel to the desired length of 1800 feet. Since the tunnel itself is 1200 feet long, we can calculate the remaining distance by subtracting the length of the tunnel from the target length. Therefore, we calculate 1800 feet - 1200 feet, which equals 600 feet. Thus, the exit of the tunnel is 600 feet from the end of the tunnel to reach the desired distance.\nTherefore, the answer is (600)\n\nQ: Following an appetizing meal, they journeyed to the Great Wall of China. There, Mia observed that 330 explorers arrived at the Great Wall of China that day. If there were 295 explorers the previous day and 400 explorers the day before that. How many visited the Great Wall of China within the past 89 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo calculate the total number of explorers who visited the Great Wall of China in the past 89 days, we first need to gather the information we have. We know the number of explorers for the last three days: 400 explorers two days ago, 295 explorers one day ago, and 330 explorers today. However, we do not have information on the number of explorers for the 86 days prior to these three days. Without more specific data or a pattern regarding daily visitors, we cannot accurately determine the total for the entire 89-day period. If we assume only these three days of data are available and the rest are unknown, we could only add the known values for an approximate total. The sum for these three days is 400 + 295 + 330 = 1025 explorers. For a complete total of the past 89 days, we need additional information on the number of visitors on each of the preceding 86 days. Lack of that data means we can only provide the sum for the three known days, but cannot extrapolate for the entire period. Hence, the answer remains incomplete without further information.\nTherefore, the answer is (1025)\n\nQ: After finishing their workout, they decided to go for a run.

How many more fish died because of the change than those that continued to live?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many fish Mia had initially in the aquarium, which is 18. Then, we consider the number of fish that died due to the sudden temperature change, which is 7. To find out how many fish are still alive, we subtract the number of fish that died from the total number of fish: 18 - 7 = 11. Now, we need to calculate how many more fish died (7) than those that continued to live (11). To get this, we subtract the number of live fish from the number of dead fish: 7 - 11 = -4. The negative sign indicates that more fish were alive than those that died.\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQ: Noah and his cousin went fishing at the lake. Together they caught fish that weighed 52 pounds. On the way home, Noah's cousin dropped 7 pounds of fish. Noah's fish now weighed 22 pounds. How much did his cousin's fish weigh now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that Noah and his cousin together caught 52 pounds of fish. Let’s denote the weight of Noah's fish as N and the weight of his cousin's fish as C. Therefore, we can write the equation: N + C = 52. Next, we know that Noah's cousin dropped 7 pounds of fish. After dropping the fish, his cousin's fish will weigh C - 7. After that, we are given that Noah's fish now weighed 22 pounds. So we can say that N = 22. Now we can substitute N in the first equation: 22 + C = 52. To find C, we can rearrange and solve for C: C = 52 - 22, which gives us C = 30. After dropping 7 pounds, we calculate the weight of the cousin's fish now: C - 7 = 30 - 7 = 23. Therefore, the answer is (23).\nTherefore, the answer is (23)\n\nQ: She then went to check the lemons being picked. She found out that they gather 55 bags per day and that each bag contains 22 lemons. How many lemons will they have after 75 days of picking?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many lemons are gathered in one day. Since they gather 55 bags per day, and each bag contains 22 lemons, we can calculate the total lemons per day by multiplying the number of bags by the number of lemons per bag: 55 bags/day * 22 lemons/bag = 1210 lemons/day. Next, we find the total number of lemons collected over 75 days. We multiply the daily total by the number of days: 1210 lemons/day * 75 days = 90750 lemons. Therefore, after 75 days of picking, they will have 90750 lemons.\nTherefore, the answer is (90750)\n\nQ: As summer ends, many fish are migrating to deeper waters.

Tom's project has 3600 words in total and took him 15 days to complete. Therefore, we divide the total number of words by the number of days: 3600 words ÷ 15 days = 240 words per day. This means Tom wrote 240 words each day while working on his project.\nTherefore, the answer is (240)\n\nQ: The car wash fundraiser made the same amount of money each day. In total in 6 days they earned 300 dollars. How much did they make per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money was made per day, we need to divide the total amount earned by the number of days. The total earnings are 300 dollars and the number of days is 6. We perform the calculation: 300 dollars ÷ 6 days = 50 dollars per day. Therefore, they made 50 dollars each day.\nTherefore, the answer is (50)\n\nQ: Sarah was working on her art project. The project consisted of 96 pieces equally distributed over 12 themes. It took Sarah 4 weeks to complete the project. How many pieces did she finish per week?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many pieces Sarah finished per week, we first need to find the total number of pieces she created and the total time taken. The total number of pieces is 96, which is distributed equally over 12 themes. Since we're only interested in the total pieces, we can skip the breakdown by theme. Next, we need to calculate how many weeks it took Sarah to complete the project, which is given as 4 weeks. Finally, we divide the total number of pieces (96) by the total number of weeks (4) to find the number of pieces completed per week. This calculation is 96 pieces / 4 weeks = 24 pieces per week.\nTherefore, the answer is (24)\n\nQ: Kevin was building a model airplane. It took him 18 days to finish it. If the model had 72 parts, how many parts did he assemble per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many parts Kevin assembled per day, we need to divide the total number of parts by the total number of days he took to finish the model airplane. The model has 72 parts and Kevin took 18 days. Therefore, we calculate 72 parts divided by 18 days. Performing the calculation: 72 ÷ 18 = 4. This means Kevin assembled 4 parts each day.\nTherefore, the answer is (4)\n\nQ: Sam was building a model train set. He added 3 pieces each day and it took him 150 days to finish assembling it. How many pieces did he add in total?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nSam added 3 pieces each day for 150 days. To find the total pieces added, we multiply the number of pieces added per day by the number of days.

{"prompt": "Q: A bakery had a total of 24 pastries of which 12 were chocolate croissants and the rest were fruit tarts. They also had 40 cookies. How many fruit tarts did they have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the number of fruit tarts, we need to first determine how many pastries are fruit tarts. We know that the total number of pastries is 24 and that there are 12 chocolate croissants. Therefore, we can calculate the number of fruit tarts by subtracting the number of chocolate croissants from the total number of pastries: 24 (total pastries) - 12 (chocolate croissants) = 12 (fruit tarts).\nTherefore, the answer is (12)\n\nQ: Lisa is making cookies. The recipe needs 6 cups of chocolate chips and 14 cups of oats. She has already put in some oats. If she still needs 8 more cups of oats, how many cups of oats did she put in?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe total amount of oats needed for the recipe is 14 cups. Lisa has already put in some oats, and she still needs 8 more cups. To find out how many cups of oats she has already added, we can use the equation: Total oats needed - Oats remaining = Oats added. Substituting the known values: 14 cups - 8 cups = 6 cups. Therefore, Lisa has put in 6 cups of oats.\nTherefore, the answer is (6)\n\nQ: Emma was helping her sister bake cookies in 5 trays. They made 25 cookies altogether. If they placed the same number of cookies on each tray, how many cookies did they place on each tray?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that Emma and her sister made 25 cookies and placed them on 5 trays. To find out how many cookies were placed on each tray, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of trays. So, we perform the calculation: 25 cookies ÷ 5 trays = 5 cookies per tray. This means that each tray has the same number of cookies, which is 5.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Liam was helping his sister bake cookies and together they mixed some ingredients. They added 15 chocolate chips in each batch. If they made 8 batches, how many chocolate chips did they use?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of chocolate chips used, we need to multiply the number of chocolate chips added in each batch by the number of batches made. Given that there are 15 chocolate chips in each batch and 8 batches were made, we perform the multiplication: 15 chocolate chips/batch * 8 batches = 120 chocolate chips. Therefore, the total number of chocolate chips used is 120.\nTherefore, the answer is (120)\n\nQ: Sarah was baking cookies. Each batch had 24 cookies and it took Sarah 2 days to bake each batch. If she takes 48 days to bake all batches, how many batches did she bake?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many batches Sarah baked, we need to determine the total time taken to bake all the batches and how many batches are completed in that time. Each batch takes 2 days to bake. Sarah took a total of 48 days to bake all batches. We can find the number of batches by dividing the total time by the time taken for each batch. So we calculate 48 days divided by 2 days per batch. This gives us: 48 / 2 = 24 batches. Therefore, Sarah baked 24 batches of cookies.\nTherefore, the answer is (24)\n\nQ: Lisa wants to bake cookies for her 15 classmates. If each bag of chocolate chips contains 5 cups, how many bags does she need to have enough for all the cookies?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many bags of chocolate chips Lisa needs, we first need to establish how many cups of chocolate chips are required for the cookies. If we assume that for each classmate, Lisa will bake a certain number of cookies that collectively require a specific amount of chocolate chips, we need that information to proceed. Let's say, hypothetically, that each cookie requires a quarter cup of chocolate chips and she intends to bake 2 cookies per classmate, which would mean 30 cookies total. Therefore, 30 cookies multiplied by 0.25 cups per cookie equals 7.5 cups of chocolate chips needed. Since each bag contains 5 cups, we divide the total cups needed (7.5) by the amount per bag (5). This results in 1.5 bags. Since you cannot purchase half a bag, Lisa will need to round up to 2 bags to ensure she has enough chocolate chips to meet her requirement for 30 cookies. Thus, the answer is 2 bags.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQ: In Ava's team, 7 are kids who enjoy baking. If Ava has 25 cookies and wants to keep 15 cookies for herself. How many will each of the kids receive?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many cookies Ava has left after keeping some for herself. She has 25 cookies and decides to keep 15 for herself. We subtract the number of cookies she keeps from the total: 25 - 15 = 10 cookies. Next, we need to find out how many cookies each of the 7 kids will receive. We will divide the remaining cookies by the number of kids: 10 cookies ÷ 7 kids = approximately 1.4286 cookies per kid. Since we typically cannot divide cookies into fractions for distribution, we can consider providing 1 cookie to each kid, and there will be 3 cookies left over. Thus, each of the 7 kids will effectively receive 1 cookie, and 3 cookies will remain undistributed.\nTherefore, the answer is (1)\n\nQ: Jake was helping his sister bake cookies and together they made 24 batches. They used 6 ingredients in each batch and only 30 cookies came out perfect from each batch.

{"prompt": "Q: David and his aunt went cherry picking. Together they collected cherries that weighed 19 pounds. On the way back, David's aunt found 6 more pounds of cherries. David's cherries now weighed 22 pounds. How much did his aunt's cherries weigh now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, David and his aunt collected cherries weighing a total of 19 pounds. Let's denote David's weight of cherries as D and his aunt's weight of cherries as A. Therefore, we have the equation D + A = 19. Later, David's aunt found 6 more pounds of cherries, increasing her total weight of cherries to A + 6. Now, David reports that his cherries weigh 22 pounds. Therefore, D = 22. Substituting this value into the first equation gives us 22 + A = 19. Solving for A, we find A = 19 - 22, which gives A = -3. However, we need to take into account the 6 additional pounds that the aunt found. Therefore, her new total would be A + 6 = (-3) + 6 = 3 pounds. Hence, David's aunt's cherries weigh 3 pounds now.\nTherefore, the answer is (3)\n\nQ: Lisa and her dad went blueberry picking. They collected blueberries that weighed 50 pounds together. On the way back, Lisa's dad lost 10 pounds of blueberries. Lisa's blueberries now weighed 18 pounds. How much did her dad's blueberries weigh now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Lisa and her dad collected a total of 50 pounds of blueberries. After Lisa's dad lost 10 pounds, the total weight of blueberries they had was 50 - 10 = 40 pounds. We also know that Lisa's blueberries weigh 18 pounds now. Therefore, the weight of her dad's blueberries is the new total weight of blueberries (40 pounds) minus the weight of Lisa's blueberries (18 pounds). Thus, her dad's blueberries now weigh 40 - 18 = 22 pounds.\nTherefore, the answer is (22)\n\nQ: Lily and her mom went apple picking. Together they collected apples that weighed 18 pounds. On the way back, Lily's mom found 25 more pounds of apples. Lily's apples now weighed 30 pounds. How much did her mom's apples weigh now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Lily and her mom collected a total of 18 pounds of apples. When her mom found 25 more pounds of apples, we need to determine the total weight of apples both collected. After finding the additional apples, Lily's apples alone weighed 30 pounds. Hence, we can calculate the mom's apples. First, let's denote the initial weight of mommy's apples as 'x'. From their initial collection, we know: x + (weight of Lily's apples) = 18 pounds. Since Lily's apples now weigh 30 pounds, we first need to determine what her initial weight was. Since the combined weight of their initial collection was 18 pounds, we can calculate: x + (initial weight of Lily's apples) = 18, so (initial weight of Lily's apples) = 18 - x. Since now Lily's weight is increased to 30 pounds, the additional weight added to Lily's apples from initial collection can be calculated as (30 - (18 - x)). Now if mom found an additional 25 pounds, the total weight of mom's apples now is: x + 25 pounds. Therefore, to find the current weight of mom's apples, we can express it in terms of the initial weight of apples collected: x + 25 = (30 - (18 - x)) + 25. By isolating the variables we can solve for 'x'. However, to find just mom's current weight without determining 'x', we can see Lily's increase and knowing the additional amount found. So if initially x was part of collection as 18, with 25 added makes her total higher. And to finalize, 30 - 18 is +12, indicating every pound found maxed her at 30. Thus mom's can be said slightly bounded by the logic increasing to +25 again special weight now to account from base before. Thus the mom's apples current weight = 30 - (18 - (18 - 18+x)) + 25 = 12. Hence this reflects a combined final balance directly back toward how many could sum we'd find by transition now. Hence x entirely transitioned back legitimating equals values from 30 + 25 would simplify again, restoring just how much this holds as an equation rather than needing exact determination for individual x varies back. So answers interpreted mean to share doubled plus confirms this fruit rounding captures this balance, centering logic relative gains. Final resolution seeks to validate mom's = 30 after adjustments were +25 worth collectively = thus totaling into a 43x from gaining here. \nTherefore, the answer is (43)\n\nQ: Sophia and her mom went to the orchard. They together harvested peaches that weighed 60 pounds. On the way home, Sophia's mom lost 15 pounds of peaches. Sophia's peaches now weighed 20 pounds. How much did her mom's peaches weigh now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \n1. Sophia and her mom together harvested 60 pounds of peaches.\n2. Sophia's peaches now weigh 20 pounds.\n3. To find out how much peaches her mom originally had, we subtract Sophia's peaches from the total harvested: 60 - 20 = 40 pounds.\n4. Initially, her mom had 40 pounds of peaches.\n5. On the way home, her mom lost 15 pounds of peaches.\n6. We subtract the lost weight from her mom's original amount: 40 - 15 = 25 pounds.\n7. Therefore, the current weight of her mom's peaches is 25 pounds.\nTherefore, the answer is (25)\n\nQ: Ryan and his grandma went cucumber picking. Together they collected cucumbers that weighed 20 pounds. On the way back, Ryan's grandma found 15 more pounds of cucumbers. Ryan's cucumbers now weighed 25 pounds. How much did his grandma's cucumbers weigh now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \n1. Initially, Ryan and his grandma collected cucumbers weighing a total of 20 pounds. \n2. Let's denote the weight of Ryan's cucumbers as R and the weight of his grandma's cucumbers as G. Thus, we have the equation R + G = 20. \n3. On the way back, Ryan's grandma found 15 more pounds of cucumbers, which increases the weight of her cucumbers: G + 15. \n4. We know that Ryan's cucumbers now weigh 25 pounds. This means that the weight of Ryan's cucumbers has increased by 5 pounds since they were originally 20 pounds combined with his grandma's cucumbers. Therefore, we can set R = 25. \n5. From the first equation, we can substitute R into it: 25 + G = 20. \n6. Rearranging this gives G = 20 - 25, which simplifies to G = -5, contradicting the context, indicating a misunderstanding of initial conditions. \n7. Upon realizing this, we reevaluate: The initial 20 pounds include both their cucumbers, and with the grandma's added weights, the total becomes G + 15, where G was initially not specified. \n8. Thus, we say the grandma had some amount, and with her new cucumbers, we set: G (initial) + 15 (new) = G_final. \n9. We conclude Ryan garnered additional cucumbers making, the grandmother's total now reflected by G + 15 pounds.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\nQ: Sophia and her dad went pumpkin picking. Together they collected pumpkins that weighed 24 pounds. On the way back, Sophia's dad found 35 more pounds of pumpkins. Sophia's pumpkins now weighed 40 pounds. How much did her dad's pumpkins weigh now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, Sophia and her dad collected pumpkins weighing a total of 24 pounds. Let us denote the weight of Sophia's pumpkins as S and her dad's pumpkins as D. Therefore, we can set up the equation: S + D = 24. Later, Sophia's dad found an additional 35 pounds of pumpkins, which increases the weight of his pumpkins to (D + 35). We know that after this, Sophia's pumpkins weighed 40 pounds, which implies that her initial pumpkins must recount now as D + 35 = 24 - S + 35. However, we are interested only in the dad's pumpkins after he found the extra 35 pounds. We solve for D: initially, D = 24 - S and then we know S = 40, thus D = 24 - 40, giving D a value of -16, which is not logical in this case. Thus, we need to reconcile the weights to find out the dad's total post-collection. After examining, D must incorporate the weight gained from 35 pounds, thus D becomes D + 35 where D originally must have been calculated to balance with Sophia's. Therefore, the dad's pumpkins weigh now (D + 35) as we established earlier, computing results in D + 35 = 40 - 24 + 35 means dad must account for at least an original weight of 16 to yield 24 with Sophia weighing 40 gives us a final dad's count. We finalize that initially dad's weight we must assume retained should logically come through to D's calculations returning (24 + 35) pounds ultimately in collection making dad's account finalized as 35 pounds.\nTherefore, the answer is (35)\n\nQ: Ryan and his dad went to a farmer's market. They bought vegetables that weighed 40 pounds combined. On the way home, Ryan's dad lost 10 pounds of vegetables. Ryan's vegetables now weighed 14 pounds. How much did his dad's vegetables weigh now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet's define the weight of the vegetables Ryan bought as R and the weight of his dad's vegetables as D. We know that R + D = 40 pounds. After losing some vegetables, Ryan's dad now has D - 10 pounds of vegetables. Ryan's vegetables are now given to weigh 14 pounds. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:\n1. R + D = 40\n2. R = 14\nIf we substitute R in the first equation:\n14 + D = 40\nThis simplifies to D = 40 - 14 = 26 pounds. Now, after Ryan's dad lost 10 pounds of vegetables, he now has:\nD - 10 = 26 - 10 = 16 pounds. Thus, the weight of Ryan's dad's vegetables now is 16 pounds.\nTherefore, the answer is (16)\n\nQ: James and his sister went berry picking. Together they collected blueberries that weighed 16 pounds. On the way back, James's sister found 20 more pounds of blueberries. James's blueberries now weighed 28 pounds. How much did his sister's blueberries weigh now?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, James and his sister collected a total of 16 pounds of blueberries together. If we let J represent the weight of James's blueberries and S represent the weight of his sister's blueberries, we have: J + S = 16. After finding 20 more pounds of blueberries, James's sister now has S + 20 pounds of blueberries. Given that James's blueberries now weigh 28 pounds, we know that J must also equal 28 pounds. We can now use these equations: 1) J + S = 16 and 2) J = 28. Substituting J in the first equation gives us: 28 + S = 16. Solving for S, we find S = 16 - 28, which results in a negative weight (impossible). Therefore, we need to reconsider the problem. Since James's blueberries were initially part of the 16 pounds and he now has 28 pounds after the sister found 20 more pounds, these 28 pounds include the amount he had originally. Therefore, by using J = 28 pounds, we confirm his sister initially had S = 16 - J = 16 - 28 = -12 (impossible). Since he originally had 12 pounds (from deductive reasoning now), and after 20 more were found, his sister then has: S_final = original S + 20 = 12 + 20 = 32 pounds. Thus, after all calculations, James's sister’s blueberries weigh now 32 pounds.\nTherefore, the answer is (32)\n\nQuestion: Marco and his dad went strawberry picking.

Therefore, each person received the same number of pizzas.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (1.5).)\n\nQ: He then went to see the grapes being picked. He found out that they gather 80 baskets per day and that each basket contains 20 grapes. How many grapes are picked if they gather a total of 40 baskets of grapes?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of grapes picked when 40 baskets are gathered, we first need to know how many grapes are in one basket. According to the information provided, each basket contains 20 grapes. So, the total number of grapes can be calculated by multiplying the number of baskets (40) by the number of grapes in each basket (20). This gives us the equation: 40 baskets * 20 grapes/basket = 800 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes picked is 800.\nTherefore, the answer is (800)\n\nQ: He then visited the field to see the tomatoes being gathered. He learned that they collect 20 crates of unripe tomatoes and 15 crates of ripe tomatoes per day. How many crates of ripe tomatoes will they have after 50 days of collection?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many crates of ripe tomatoes will be gathered after 50 days, we first identify the daily collection of ripe tomatoes, which is 15 crates per day. Next, we multiply the daily collection by the total number of days: 15 crates/day * 50 days = 750 crates. Therefore, after 50 days of collection, they will have 750 crates of ripe tomatoes.\nTherefore, the answer is (750)\n\nQ: Ava picked 11 ripe grapes from her vine.

Out of these 4 grapes left, 2 are ripe. To find the number of unripe grapes, we can subtract the number of ripe grapes from the total number of grapes left on the vine. Total grapes left = 4, Ripe grapes = 2. Therefore, the number of unripe grapes = Total grapes - Ripe grapes = 4 - 2 = 2.\nTherefore, the answer is (2)\n\nQ: A farmer had 300 bell peppers in his garden. If he harvested 90 of them yesterday and 55 today. How many did he have left after yesterday's harvest?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThe farmer starts with 300 bell peppers.

We know that 20 insect families flew away. To find the number of insect families that stayed behind, we subtract the number of families that flew away from the total number of families: 90 - 20 = 70. Now, to determine how many more families stayed behind than those that flew away, we subtract the number of families that flew away from the number that stayed: 70 - 20 = 50. Therefore, there are 50 more insect families that stayed behind than those that flew away.\nTherefore, the answer is (50)\n\nQ: Fall is nearly here and many insects are preparing to burrow for the cold season. 50 insect families left for warmer climates from the garden. If there were 25 insect families living in the garden initially, how many more insect families left than those that remained?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 25 insect families living in the garden. 50 insect families left for warmer climates. Therefore, the number of insect families that remained in the garden is 25 - the number that left. Since 50 insect families left and only 25 were present, all 25 families must have left first. The total number of families that left is 50, and since all 25 families initially present left, we calculate how many more left than remained: 50 (left) - 0 (remained) = 50. Therefore, the number of insect families that left is higher by 50 than those that remained in the garden.\nTherefore, the answer is (50)\n\nQ: Summer is approaching and many animals are returning from their winter habitats. 60 fish species swam back to the rivers near the lake. If there were 30 fish species living in the lake initially, how many more fish species returned than those that remained?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that there were initially 30 fish species living in the lake. When 60 fish species returned to the rivers near the lake, we can determine how many species remained by subtracting the initial species from those that returned. The number of species that returned is 60 and those that remained in the lake is 30. Now, to find how many more fish species returned than those that remained, we calculate the difference between the number of species that returned and those that remained: 60 (returned) - 30 (remained) = 30. Thus, 30 more fish species returned than those that remained.\nTherefore, the answer is (30)\n\nQ: Spring is coming and a lot of butterflies are migrating to greener areas. There were 65 butterfly species in the garden. If 10 butterfly species flew away for spring, how many more butterfly species stayed than those that flew away?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nStart with the total number of butterfly species in the garden, which is 65. If 10 butterfly species flew away, we need to calculate how many species remained in the garden. To find this, subtract the number of species that flew away from the total: 65 - 10 = 55. Now, to find out how many more species stayed than those that flew away, we calculate the difference between the number of species that stayed (55) and those that flew away (10): 55 - 10 = 45. Therefore, there are 45 more butterfly species that stayed than those that flew away.\nTherefore, the answer is (45)\n\nQ: When the rainy season approaches, numerous bird species are moving to coastal areas. There were 80 bird species nesting in the forest. If 40 bird species migrated for the rain, how many more bird species flew away than those that remained?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with 80 bird species nesting in the forest. When the rainy season approaches, 40 bird species migrate away from the forest to coastal areas. To find out how many more bird species flew away than those that remained, we first calculate how many species remained after migration. The number of species that remained in the forest is 80 - 40 = 40 species. Now, we compare the number that flew away (40 species) to those that remained (40 species). The difference is 40 - 40 = 0. Therefore, there are no more bird species that flew away than those that remained.\nTherefore, the answer is (0)\n\nQ: The rainy months have begun, and many bird families are relocating to drier regions. There were 110 bird families nesting in the trees. If 25 bird families left for the drier months, how many more bird families stayed behind than those that left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nInitially, there were 110 bird families nesting in the trees. Out of these, 25 bird families left for the drier months. To find out how many bird families stayed behind, we need to subtract the number of families that left from the initial number: 110 - 25 = 85. Now, we need to find out how many more bird families stayed behind than those that left. We calculate this by subtracting the number of families that left from the number that stayed: 85 - 25 = 60. Therefore, 60 more bird families stayed behind than those that left.\nTherefore, the answer is (60)\n\nQuestion: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n", "true_answer": 127.0}
{"prompt": "Q: Tom's aunt created cupcakes for 14 partygoers but 6 partygoers did not show up. If she baked 28 cupcakes and each partygoer had the same number of cupcakes, how many did each of them have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we find out how many partygoers actually showed up. Since there were originally 14 partygoers and 6 did not show up, we calculate the number of attendees as follows: 14 - 6 = 8 partygoers. Next, we know that Tom's aunt baked 28 cupcakes for these guests. To determine how many cupcakes each attendee received, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of attendees: 28 cupcakes ÷ 8 partygoers = 3.5 cupcakes per partygoer. Therefore, each partygoer had 3.5 cupcakes.\nTherefore, the answer is ((3.5))\n\nQ: Daniel's cousin arranged snacks for 11 friends but 8 friends were unavailable. If he provided 22 snacks and each friend had the same number of snacks, how many did each of them have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nDaniel's cousin arranged snacks for 11 friends but only 3 were available (11 - 8 = 3). He provided 22 snacks in total. To find out how many snacks each of the 3 friends had, we divide the total number of snacks by the number of available friends: 22 snacks / 3 friends = 7.33 snacks per friend. Therefore, each of the available friends had approximately 7.33 snacks.\nTherefore, the answer is ((7.33))\n\nQ: Tom's aunt cooked pizzas for 6. She baked 24 pizzas but had to toss 15 pizzas. If each of them was given the same number of pizzas, how many did each of them receive?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTom's aunt baked 24 pizzas and tossed 15 of them, which means she has 24 - 15 = 9 pizzas left. There are 6 people in total, so we need to divide the remaining pizzas by the number of people: 9 pizzas ÷ 6 people = 1.5 pizzas per person. Therefore, each person received the same number of pizzas.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (1.5).)\n\nQ: Jake was helping his sister bake cookies and together they made 24 batches. They used 6 ingredients in each batch and only 30 cookies came out perfect from each batch. How many cookies did they bake?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find the total number of cookies baked by Jake and his sister, we need to multiply the number of batches by the number of perfect cookies produced in each batch. They made 24 batches and from each batch, they got 30 perfect cookies. Therefore, we calculate: 24 batches * 30 cookies/batch = 720 cookies. Hence, the total number of cookies baked is 720.\nTherefore, the answer is (720)\n\nQ: Lisa's father baked pies for 12 guests but 5 guests did not arrive. If he made 30 pies and each guest had the same number of pies, how many did each of them have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \n1. Lisa's father baked pies for 12 guests, but only 7 guests arrived (12 guests - 5 guests who did not arrive). 2. He made a total of 30 pies. 3. To find out how many pies each of the 7 guests had, we divide the total number of pies by the number of guests that arrived: 30 pies / 7 guests = approximately 4.2857 pies per guest. 4. Since we are seeking the quantity each guest had, we can keep it in decimal form. Therefore, each guest had approximately 4.2857 pies.\nTherefore, the answer is (Therefore, the answer is (4.2857).)\n\nQ: Mark's sister prepared sandwiches for 15 friends but 10 friends were not able to make it. If she made 25 sandwiches and each friend had the same number of sandwiches, how many did each of them have?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nMark's sister prepared sandwiches for 15 friends, but only 5 friends were able to make it (since 10 friends were not able to come). She made a total of 25 sandwiches. To find out how many sandwiches each of the 5 friends had, we need to divide the total number of sandwiches by the number of friends who actually came. So, we calculate 25 sandwiches divided by 5 friends, which equals 5 sandwiches. Therefore, each friend had 5 sandwiches.\nTherefore, the answer is (5)\n\nQ: Sara was hosting a dinner party for her family. Each tray of desserts she made contained 12 pieces and she made 2 trays. Then she baked 10 extra pieces. How many family members can she serve dessert to?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, calculate the total number of dessert pieces made by Sara. Each tray contains 12 pieces and she made 2 trays, so the number of pieces from the trays is 12 pieces/tray * 2 trays = 24 pieces. Next, add the extra 10 pieces she baked. The total number of pieces is 24 pieces + 10 pieces = 34 pieces. This means Sara can serve a total of 34 pieces of dessert to her family members.\nTherefore, the answer is (34)\n\nQ: Emma dealt out the same amount of ice cream and cake pops to her 32 friends. Starting off, she had 15 ice creams and 20 cake pops. How many ice creams and cake pops did each friend receive?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many ice creams and cake pops each friend received, we need to distribute the total amount of ice cream and cake pops equally among the 32 friends. 1. Start with the total number of ice creams: Emma has 15 ice creams. We divide this by the number of friends: 15 ice creams / 32 friends = 0.46875 ice creams per friend. 2. Next, consider the total number of cake pops: Emma has 20 cake pops. We divide this by the number of friends: 20 cake pops / 32 friends = 0.625 cake pops per friend. Therefore, each friend received approximately 0.46875 ice creams and 0.625 cake pops.\nTherefore, the answer is ((0.46875 ice creams, 0.625 cake pops))\n\nQuestion: Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: Nell collects cards. She had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards.

How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday.

Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: Next on his checklist is wax to stick the feathers together.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3.

How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday.

Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: Robin has 28 packages of gum and 14 packages of candy.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold.

Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold.

This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: There were 2 roses in the vase.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold.

This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold.

This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: Bobby had 20 pieces of candy. He ate 34 pieces of candy.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold.

This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold.

This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: 6 birds were sitting on the fence. 4 more birds and 8 more storks came to join them.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold.

There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold.

How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold.

Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: Melissa scored 109 points in each game.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold.

How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday.

{"prompt": "Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers.

Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: If the cave is 919 feet deep and they need to travel 1307 feet.

If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many more bird families flew away than those that stayed behind, we first need to identify how many bird families stayed. Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: An industrial machine can make 6 shirts a minute.

Since there were initially 45 bird families and 86 flew away, we can calculate the number of families that stayed. The number of families that stayed is: 45 (initial families) - 86 (families that flew away). Since 86 is more than 45, this means all families flew away and there would be negative families that stayed. Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: A farmer had 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes in his garden.

Hence, to find out how many more families flew away than those that stayed, we can calculate 86 - 0 (the negative stay making the number of stay families effectively zero). So, the result will be 86. Thus, 86 bird families flew away and 0 families stayed behind. Therefore, the difference is 86 - 0 = 86. \nTherefore, the answer is (127.0)\n\nQ: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we first need to determine the daily output of drums of grapes. We know from the problem statement that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day. Therefore, the daily output of drums of grapes is simply 244. Now, we will multiply the daily output by the number of days to find the total output over 146 days. The calculation will be: 244 drums/day * 146 days = 35,624 drums. Thus, the final answer, representing the total number of drums filled in that timeframe, is determined.\nTherefore, the answer is (35624.0)\n\nQ: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how many pages Frank read per day, we first need to determine the total number of pages in the book, which is given as 450 pages. Since it took Frank 30 days to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days to find the average number of pages he read each day. That is calculated as 450 pages divided by 30 days, which equals 15 pages per day. Therefore, we conclude our reasoning.\nTherefore, the answer is (15.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo determine how many nails John needs for the house wall, we first calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Each large plank requires 17 nails and there are 13 large planks. Thus, the nails for large planks are calculated as follows:\n\nNails for large planks = Number of large planks * Nails per large plank = 13 * 17 = 221 nails.\n\nIn addition to the nails for the large planks, there are also 8 nails needed for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails John needs is the sum of the nails for large planks and the nails for smaller planks:\n\nTotal nails = Nails for large planks + Nails for smaller planks = 221 + 8 = 229 nails.\n\nHence, John's total requirement for nails is 229.\nTherefore, the answer is (229.0)\n\nQ: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that John uses a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. Additionally, it is mentioned that for each plank, 3 nails are necessary. Further, there are 8 extra nails that were used. We can set up the equation to determine the number of planks, P. The total number of nails used can be expressed as the sum of nails used for the planks and the additional nails: 3P + 8 = 11. Now, we will isolate P: 3P = 11 - 8, which simplifies to 3P = 3. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us P = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\nTherefore, the answer is (1.0)\n\nQ: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the arkansas game?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to follow these steps: First, we know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Each t-shirt is sold for $98. Therefore, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt: 89 t-shirts * $98/t-shirt. This calculation gives us the total revenue generated from the t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game.\nTherefore, the answer is (8722.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nWe start with the initial number of bird families near the mountain, which is 3. Then, 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total count. We add these two numbers: 3 + 26 = 29. Next, we account for the 2 bird families that fly away for winter, which decreases the total count. So we subtract: 29 - 2 = 27. The final count of bird families remaining near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nPaul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. By the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he still had all 38 erasers. We need to find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left. First, we find the difference between the number of crayons and the number of erasers left: 391 (crayons left) - 38 (erasers left) = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.\nTherefore, the answer is (353.0)\n\nQuestion: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house.

How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the day in question compared to the previous 245 days, we first need to calculate the total number of visitors over those days. This can be achieved by averaging the known visitors over the previous three days, assuming that they represent a reasonable estimate of visitor numbers for the 245 days prior.\n\n1. Visitors on Day X (the day in question) = 705\n2. Visitors the previous day (Day X-1) = 191\n3. Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house.

How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nTo find how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the day in question compared to the previous 245 days, we first need to calculate the total number of visitors over those days. This can be achieved by averaging the known visitors over the previous three days, assuming that they represent a reasonable estimate of visitor numbers for the 245 days prior.\n\n1. Visitors on Day X (the day in question) = 705\n2. Visitors the previous day (Day X-1) = 191\n3. Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. Now we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today from those baked yesterday to find out how many more she baked yesterday compared to today. Therefore, we calculate 197 - 66, which equals 131 cookies.\nTherefore, the answer is (131.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more raisin cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 300 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 280 raisin cookies. Now, we will subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday: 300 - 280 = 20. This tells us that Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: Next on his checklist is wax to stick the feathers together.

This can be achieved by averaging the known visitors over the previous three days, assuming that they represent a reasonable estimate of visitor numbers for the 245 days prior.\n\n1. Visitors on Day X (the day in question) = 705\n2. Visitors the previous day (Day X-1) = 191\n3. Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. Now we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today from those baked yesterday to find out how many more she baked yesterday compared to today. Therefore, we calculate 197 - 66, which equals 131 cookies.\nTherefore, the answer is (131.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more raisin cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 300 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 280 raisin cookies. Now, we will subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday: 300 - 280 = 20. This tells us that Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested bacon be denoted as x. According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: Jack received 6 emails in the morning, 3 emails in the afternoon and some more in the evening.

Visitors on Day X (the day in question) = 705\n2. Visitors the previous day (Day X-1) = 191\n3. Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. Now we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today from those baked yesterday to find out how many more she baked yesterday compared to today. Therefore, we calculate 197 - 66, which equals 131 cookies.\nTherefore, the answer is (131.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more raisin cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 300 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 280 raisin cookies. Now, we will subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday: 300 - 280 = 20. This tells us that Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested bacon be denoted as x. According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: A waiter had 3 customers. After some left he still had 4 customers.

Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. Now we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today from those baked yesterday to find out how many more she baked yesterday compared to today. Therefore, we calculate 197 - 66, which equals 131 cookies.\nTherefore, the answer is (131.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more raisin cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 300 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 280 raisin cookies. Now, we will subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday: 300 - 280 = 20. This tells us that Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394.

Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. Now we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today from those baked yesterday to find out how many more she baked yesterday compared to today. Therefore, we calculate 197 - 66, which equals 131 cookies.\nTherefore, the answer is (131.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies this morning.

There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes.

We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348.

To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. Now we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today from those baked yesterday to find out how many more she baked yesterday compared to today. Therefore, we calculate 197 - 66, which equals 131 cookies.\nTherefore, the answer is (131.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more raisin cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 300 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 280 raisin cookies. Now, we will subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday: 300 - 280 = 20. This tells us that Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: Lewis earns $ 28 every week during the 1091 weeks of harvest. He also earns $ 939 per week for working overtime.

Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. Now we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today from those baked yesterday to find out how many more she baked yesterday compared to today. Therefore, we calculate 197 - 66, which equals 131 cookies.\nTherefore, the answer is (131.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more raisin cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 300 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 280 raisin cookies. Now, we will subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday: 300 - 280 = 20. This tells us that Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: Emily is making bead necklaces for her friends. She had 2 beads and she was able to make 32 necklaces.

Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. Now we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today from those baked yesterday to find out how many more she baked yesterday compared to today. Therefore, we calculate 197 - 66, which equals 131 cookies.\nTherefore, the answer is (131.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more raisin cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 300 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 280 raisin cookies. Now, we will subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday: 300 - 280 = 20. This tells us that Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: 6 birds were sitting on the fence. 4 more birds and 8 more storks came to join them.

Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. Now we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today from those baked yesterday to find out how many more she baked yesterday compared to today. Therefore, we calculate 197 - 66, which equals 131 cookies.\nTherefore, the answer is (131.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more raisin cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 300 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 280 raisin cookies. Now, we will subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday: 300 - 280 = 20. This tells us that Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds.

Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. Now we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today from those baked yesterday to find out how many more she baked yesterday compared to today. Therefore, we calculate 197 - 66, which equals 131 cookies.\nTherefore, the answer is (131.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more raisin cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 300 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 280 raisin cookies. Now, we will subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday: 300 - 280 = 20. This tells us that Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: Bobby ate 28 pieces of candy. Then he ate 42 more. He also ate 63 pieces of chocolate.

Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. Now we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today from those baked yesterday to find out how many more she baked yesterday compared to today. Therefore, we calculate 197 - 66, which equals 131 cookies.\nTherefore, the answer is (131.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more raisin cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 300 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 280 raisin cookies. Now, we will subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday: 300 - 280 = 20. This tells us that Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394.

Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. Now we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today from those baked yesterday to find out how many more she baked yesterday compared to today. Therefore, we calculate 197 - 66, which equals 131 cookies.\nTherefore, the answer is (131.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more raisin cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 300 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 280 raisin cookies. Now, we will subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday: 300 - 280 = 20. This tells us that Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: A farmer had 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden. If he picked 172 potatoes.

Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. Now we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today from those baked yesterday to find out how many more she baked yesterday compared to today. Therefore, we calculate 197 - 66, which equals 131 cookies.\nTherefore, the answer is (131.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more raisin cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 300 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 280 raisin cookies. Now, we will subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday: 300 - 280 = 20. This tells us that Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: If Lewis earns $ 1357 every week during the 223 weeks of a harvest season.

Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. Now we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today from those baked yesterday to find out how many more she baked yesterday compared to today. Therefore, we calculate 197 - 66, which equals 131 cookies.\nTherefore, the answer is (131.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more raisin cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 300 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 280 raisin cookies. Now, we will subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday: 300 - 280 = 20. This tells us that Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary in gym class today. If David did 38 push-ups.

Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. Now we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today from those baked yesterday to find out how many more she baked yesterday compared to today. Therefore, we calculate 197 - 66, which equals 131 cookies.\nTherefore, the answer is (131.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more raisin cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 300 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 280 raisin cookies. Now, we will subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday: 300 - 280 = 20. This tells us that Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: Dan has $ 4. He had $ 3 left with him after he bought a candy bar.

Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. Now we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today from those baked yesterday to find out how many more she baked yesterday compared to today. Therefore, we calculate 197 - 66, which equals 131 cookies.\nTherefore, the answer is (131.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more raisin cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 300 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 280 raisin cookies. Now, we will subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday: 300 - 280 = 20. This tells us that Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: You had 14 bags with equal number of cookies. If you had 28 cookies and 86 candies in total.

Visitors the day before that (Day X-2) = 457\n\nNext, we calculate the total visitors in the three known days:\n- Total visitors over these three days = 705 + 191 + 457 = 1353\n- Average visitors per day over these three days = 1353 / 3 = 451\n\nNow, we can estimate the number of visitors for the previous 245 days. Assuming this average holds for all these days:\n- Total visitors in the previous 245 days = 245 * 451 = 110,695\n\nFinally, we find the difference between the visitors on the day in question and the estimated total visits over the previous 245 days:\n- Difference = Visitors on Day X - Average visitors for 245 days\n- Difference = 705 - (110,695 / 245) calculating gives 705 - 451 = 254.\n\nThus, the value of how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the average of the previous 245 days is 254.\nTherefore, the answer is (57.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 66 chocolate chip cookies. Now we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked today from those baked yesterday to find out how many more she baked yesterday compared to today. Therefore, we calculate 197 - 66, which equals 131 cookies.\nTherefore, the answer is (131.0)\n\nQ: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies yesterday. And she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more raisin cookies did Helen bake yesterday compared to today?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to determine how many raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday, Helen baked 300 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 280 raisin cookies. Now, we will subtract the number of raisin cookies baked today from the number baked yesterday: 300 - 280 = 20. This tells us that Helen baked 20 more raisin cookies yesterday compared to today.\nTherefore, the answer is (20.0)\n\nQ: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nThere are initially 3 bird families near the mountain. 26 new bird families arrive from the arctic, which increases the total number of bird families to 3 + 26 = 29. Then, 2 bird families fly away, so we subtract 2 from the total: 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, the total number of bird families left near the mountain is 27.\nTherefore, the answer is (27.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes be denoted as M. According to the problem, we know that M = 182. We also know that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, if we let B denote the number of students who suggested bacon, we can express this relationship as B = M + 166. Substituting M with 182 gives us B = 182 + 166. Calculating this, we find B = 348. Thus, the number of students who suggested bacon is 348.\nTherefore, the answer is (348.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food from a total of 66 choices. If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate. How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we know that a total of 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add these two numbers together since they are part of the same group of participants. Therefore, we calculate: 450 (students suggesting mashed potatoes) + 38 (students suggesting bacon) = 488. Thus, a total of 488 students participated in suggesting new food items.\nTherefore, the answer is (488.0)\n\nQ: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. How many students suggested bacon?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nLet the number of students who suggested bacon be denoted as x. According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also given that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 457 = x + 63. To solve for x, we subtract 63 from both sides: 457 - 63 = x, which simplifies to 394. Thus, 394 students suggested bacon.\nTherefore, the answer is (394.0)\n\nQuestion: Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially.
